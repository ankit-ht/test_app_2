I\u2019ve been loving tzatziki sauce on my toasts last year, and I thought it would go so well in a burger with a Korean twist. Enjoy a juicy Korean Bulgogi burger with a creamy, refreshing, crunchy sauce. \u2028\u2028\ud83c\udf54 Ingredients \ud83c\udf54\u2028\u2022 1 cup of Chobani\u00ae Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt\n\u2022 1 cup of shredded cucumbers\n\u2022 Handful of fresh dill\n\u2022 Pinch of salt\u00a0\n\u2022 Ground black pepper\n\u2022 1 tbsp olive oil\u00a0\n\u2022 1 toast\n\u2022 1/2 packet of Omsom Spicy Bulgogi Sauce\u00a0\n\u2022 150g (\u2154 cup) ground beef\n\u2022 1/3 tsp baking powder\n\u2022 Potato burger buns\n\u2022 Lettuce\n\u2022 Tomato\u00a0\n\n\ud83c\udf74 Directions \ud83c\udf74\u20281.

Chop the dill into small pieces.\n4. Place the shredded cucumbers in a paper towel and squeeze out the excess water.\n5. In a bowl, mix the Greek Yogurt, cucumbers, dill, salt, and olive oil.\n6. Shape and press the ground beef into a patty, and cook both sides on a heated oiled pan for 2 minutes on each side, or until browned.\n7. Lower the heat to the lowest setting. Add \u00bd packet of Omsom Spicy Bulgogi sauce on top of the beef patty, and flip the patty several times while the sauce bubbles and glazes over the patty. For a well-done burger, lower the heat and put a lid on top of the pan for the meat to finish cooking.\n8. On toasted buns, stack the spicy bulgogi patty, spread some tzatziki sauce, add tomato slices and some lettuce. Enjoy!\n\nChef\u2019s Tip: For extra flavor, add a teaspoon of minced garlic to the tzatziki sauce before serving.\n\n#koreanfusion #koreanfood #lunarnewyear",
