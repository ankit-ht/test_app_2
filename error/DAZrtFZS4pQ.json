With Nicole leading the way, the workshop gave our guests an opportunity to create an upcycled water bottle holder using salvaged footwear materials from Altra\u2019s development lab.\n\nThe purpose of this workshop was to focus on the importance of sustainable design and to inspire new ways of thinking about waste reduction. \n\nPhotos by @amandavillarosa",
