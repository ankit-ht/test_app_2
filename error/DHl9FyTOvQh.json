The three categories of what we\u2019re fighting for:\n\n1. Power and control\n2. Closeness and care\n3. Respect and recognition\n\nWhat do you think? Are your fights rooted in one of these categories?\n\nReel: Oprah and Esther Perel from The Oprah Podcast. \n\nDisclaimer: Content is for informational purposes and doesn\u2019t constitute therapy.
