  "caption": "Hamza Igamane is a cult hero. The Old Firm derby has a soft spot for producing classic moments, and this one is due to go platinum. Came off the bench in the 83rd minute. Bagged the winner just five minutes later. Real hitman settings. Secured Rangers\u2019 first league win at Celtic Park in four years. The Moroccan Morelos is mashing work. You\u2019re looking at a proper bagsman who can rise to the occasion and rise it when it truly matters. Pulled up to the opp block and got to chopping. Call this baller the couscous McCoist the way he led Celtic fans down a blind Ally. But let\u2019s talk about that finish. Minimal backlift, but the power could\u2019ve moved the Atlas Mountains. A winner so cold, it had V\u00e1clav \u010cern\u00fd spraying his drink on the home fans like Steve Austin. Igamane is HIM.",
