The PFA\u2019s study is the first of its kind in professional football and seeks to help establish a better understanding of neurodivergent experiences at the elite level.\u2063\n\u2063\n700 players have been surveyed so far, and preliminary findings show only 5% of participants have been formally diagnosed with a neurodiverse condition. Among the most commonly self-reported neurodiverse traits are difficulties with attention and focus (26%) and social interactions (22%).\u2063\n\u2063\nThe union\u2019s study began in October 2024 and is expected to be completed by the end of the 2024/25 season. The results will then be shared to aid the development of more inclusive practices for clubs to implement.\u2063\n\u2063\nManchester United\u2019s Safia Middleton-Patel has been diagnosed autistic and says this research study can improve understanding and awareness of neurodiversity in football.\u2063\n\u2063\n\u201cI wish it was something I had when I was younger.\u201d Middleton-Patel said. \u201cIt\u2019s really good for the players to help understand themselves more, but it will be very beneficial for clubs to find structures where they can adapt training or meetings to suit the players\u2019 needs.\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\nThis study has been a long time coming. Several current and former players with neurodiverse conditions have spoken about their experiences of playing professionally, and some have rightly called for more to be done to raise awareness of neurodiversity in football.\u2063\n\u2063\nThis research could be the progress the sport has needed.",
