It\u2019s such an easy to use website and the girls just love seeing their drawings animated in different ways - it really brings them to life \ud83d\ude0d\n.\n.\n.\n\n#everydayplayhacks #homeschool #playhacks #preschooltoys #montessoribaby #diymum #babyplayhacks #babysenory #homeschoolmum #sensoryplayideas #homeschoolmom #preschoolplay #preschoolplayideas #playathome #stayathomemum #playathomemummy #montessoriathome #preschoolactivities #preschoolactivitiesathome #toddlermum #montessoritoys #toyideas #playathomeactivities #creativekids #toyideasforkids #montessoripreschool #giftideasforkids #amazontoys #amazonfinds #cooltoys",
