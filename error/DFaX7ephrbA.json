This begins with actively listening to people\u2019s hopes and concerns about breakthrough science.\n\n@leapsbybayer, our impact investment arm, collaborated with @bcg and market research by @IPSOS_UK to conduct one of the largest surveys on global public sentiment towards transformative technology. \n\nOver 13,000 participants from 13 countries were asked about their outlook. 72% of respondents express confidence in the direction of science and technology. \n\nAt Bayer, these insights fuel our mission and support our drive to innovate responsibly and communicate meaningfully. Whether it\u2019s advancing cell and gene therapies to tackle Parkinson\u2019s disease or revolutionizing agriculture to help work towards food security, we remain committed to leading with science and building trust.\n\nFind the link to the full report in our bio.\n\n\ud83d\ude80  What excites or surprises you most from this study?
