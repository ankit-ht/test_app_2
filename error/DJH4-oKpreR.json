To be recognized alongside 99 other powerhouse women building bold, meaningful businesses? It\u2019s surreal\u2014and deeply humbling. It is also a powerful reminder that community matters, the work we\u2019re doing makes an impact, and yes\u2014we absolutely can build businesses on our own terms!\n\nI didn\u2019t start this entrepreneurial journey for recognition. I set out to make a difference\u2014to help women safeguard their dreams, and to show my boys what it looks like to stay the course when things get hard, to believe in yourself when it counts most, and to lead with both courage and conviction.\n\nThank you to @Entreprenista, @stephjillcartin and @courtspritzer for this incredible honor. And thank you to every client, colleague, and friend who has been part of this journey with me. I wouldn\u2019t be here without you, and I\u2019m forever grateful! \ud83d\ude0d\n\nHere\u2019s to showing up, lifting each other up, and continuing to build with heart. Let\u2019s write this next chapter together!",
