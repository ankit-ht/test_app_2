And then right across the street, is my all-time favorite, the LOVE sculpture, based on Robert Indiana\u2019s piece. And to top off that little stop, I had the honor of seeing Ranger Bob, @loveparkphilly , who I became friends with over the Holiday Season this past year; so to run into him down there was a real treat!! I headed off past City Hall, which is such an impressive building, with such an amazing history behind it\u2019s build process\u2026 And this is the backdrop for our Philly Duo booth @philaholidays , so of course, on my top list of favorites!! And then, to finish off my Philly favorites tour, @rdgterminalmkt is my last and final stop! I have had the honor of selling @masonmade25 @pageneralstore for almost a decade now and I love very bit of this store/web order business! Thanks for joining me on my walk around Philly and checking out some of my favorite spots that I LOVE with me! #love #philly #phillylove #philadelphia #walkaround",
