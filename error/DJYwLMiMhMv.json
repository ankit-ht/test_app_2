If you\u2019d like to join, just send me a DM.\n\nEvery week, I cover this stuff for you \u2014 explain what to watch, how to track it, and most importantly, what it actually means for the markets. \n\nI do all the heavy lifting so you don\u2019t have to. Just watch the videos and stay ahead.\n\nLink\u2019s in the bio, or feel free to send me a message if you\u2019re interested.",
