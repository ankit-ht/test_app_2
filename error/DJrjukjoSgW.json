The 42-year-old also founded social media platform Reddit and has an estimated net worth of $150 million.\n\nSpeaking on this new venture, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve bet big on women\u2019s sports before, and I\u2019m doing it again. I\u2019m honoured for the chance to help this iconic club become every American\u2019s favourite WSL team and much, much more.\u201d\n\nThis move follows an ever-growing trend of big-name investors buying into the women\u2019s game. Natalie Portman co-founded Angel City FC and is one of several high-profile owners heading up the franchise. NFL star Patrick Mahomes co-owns Kansas City Current with his wife, while Michelle Kang\u2019s London City Lionesses have just been promoted to the WSL.",
