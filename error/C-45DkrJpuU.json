Crump College of Law\u2019s first day of orientation. \u2696 \n\nThe topic was \u201cMental Wellbeing, Happiness & Success in Law School and Beyond\u201d and we talked about key practices for managing stress, anxiety, imposter syndrome and other common challenges so many law students and law face through their careers.\n\nI strongly believe that in order to work together to improve the mental health of our profession, we need to talk candidly about these challenges and to provide impactful tools for a healthier, happier and more balanced career. \n\nA huge thank you to my alma mater for prioritizing this topic, starting from day one, and I appreciate you Josh Heath, Esq. for making it happen.\n\nThe journey through law school is undoubtedly a challenge, and maintaining a strong mental health is not always easy. \n\nIn fact, according to The Path to Lawyer Well-Being (ABA, 2017), \u201cLaw students start law school with high life satisfaction and strong mental health measures. But within the first year of law school, they experience a significant increase in anxiety and depression. Research suggests that law students are among the most dissatisfied, demoralized, and depressed of any graduate student population.\u201d\u00a0\ud83d\ude31 \n\nBut, it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. There are countless tools and resources out there, and sometimes it starts with conversation and vulnerability. We can rewrite the narrative and create a healthier profession. If you are a law school, bar association or law firm, and you would like collaborate on ways to improve our profession together, let\u2019s chat.\n\n\u00a0#lawschool #mentalwellbing #lawyers #mentalhealth",
