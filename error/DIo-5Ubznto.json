Still, he pushed forward, studying at Virginia Union University, an HBCU, and later launching his broadcasting career at a local TV station where his image was initially hidden behind a screen to conceal his race.\u2060\n\u2060\nBut Robinson refused to be silenced or sidelined.\u2060\n\u2060\nHe rose to national prominence not just for his commanding presence and journalistic excellence, but for using his platform to speak truth to power and advocate for more honest representation of Black communities in media. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\u2060\n\u2060\nFollow @officialblackwallstreet for more Black excellence and Black-owned businesses. \u2728\ufe0f",
