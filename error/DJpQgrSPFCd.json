  "caption": "What goes into harvesting the most nutrient-dense red meat in North America? This rare behind-the-scenes video gives you a glimpse into an amazing operation. You can find the full-length 5-minute version on Momentous\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nGreat collab between @mauinuivenison and @live.momentous. Long-term consumer and supporter of both. Fuel practically kept me alive for a week last fall in Colorado. I\u2019d probably still be sleeping under a tarp up there without it. If you\u2019re going hard and long, it really works.\n\nTo try their limited-edition POG Fuel, just go to tim.blog/pog Here\u2019s what that does:\n\n$10 of every Fuel purchase goes to Maui Nui\u2019s Holo \u2019Ai food sharing program, which donates venison to food-insecure families on Maui. They\u2019ve donated 800,000+ meals to date, and every meal makes a difference in the community.",
