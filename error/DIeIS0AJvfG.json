This next-generation update delivers a revitalized underfoot experience with an additional 3mm in heel-to-toe drop. Delivering the same ultralight cushioning that made the Clifton a fan favorite, we\u2019ve fine-tuned the fit and added a breathable jacquard upper with double-lace lock to mitigate tongue migration. \n\n#FlyHumanFly #HOKA #Clifton10",
