  "caption": "Sometimes investing can be so abstract when you\u2019re looking at charts and talking theory, so I figured I\u2019d just show you what stupid buttons to click on. It\u2019s really easy. It takes about five minutes. WHY we do it this way (Roth IRA, target date index fund, buy and hold, stay the course, etc) is a longer explanation, but if you\u2019re new to investing, at least we can demystify what it actually looks like to invest.\n\nIt\u2019s really as easy as shown in this post. If you\u2019re someone who has NEVER INVESTED before, I highly recommend doing this. Fidelity and the funds listed here have $0 minimums. Go open an account and throw in 50 bucks. That simple exercise can help eliminate the \u201cstatic friction\u201d keeping so many people from getting started. The fear of the unknown or worry about getting it wrong keeps so many people on the sidelines. Go give it a try with just a little bit of money and watch it while you keep learning more.\n\nThe buttons to click are really easy. I show you them here. BUT I read ALL THE TIME stats like this: \u201cThe market averages 10% per year but the average investor averages 4%\u201d. That difference between what human investors make vs what the market returns is MASSIVE. And it all comes down to human behavior. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to understand WHAT and WHY you are doing this rather than just clicking the buttons, or else you\u2019ll be sure to go back in and unclick them one of these months and be apart of that statistic.\n\nI\u2019m doing my BEST to explain this stuff over instagram, but if you want to actually get the A-Z class on how to do that it\u2019s on sale now! Check my link in bio. It will make you millions but is only $69 through Sunday!\n\np.s. Anyone who buys a course this week also gets a free $20 gift card to the PFC shop so you can get yourself a t-shirt or mug or whatever! :)\n\nAs always, reminding you to build wealth by following the two PFC rules: 1.) Live below your means and 2.) Invest early and often.\n\n-Jeremy\n\n#fidelity #invest #learntoinvest",
