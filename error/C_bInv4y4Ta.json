Mak replied with so much excitement, a very big YES! I made him promise not to say anything and that night at the A\u2019s fireworks show\u2026we made it official with Makhai by our side while fireworks lit up the sky \ud83c\udf89 It was a truly magical moment. This picture was taken that very night! \nHAPPY 6 YEAR ANNIVERSARY! \nThank you and Makhai for lighting up my world!!! \ud83d\ude18",
