But she\u2019s seen the impact salty hydration has on her students, too. Especially after an hour practicing yoga (and sweating) at 104\u00b0 F.\n\n\u201cElectrolytes are a huge part of being able to enjoy how you feel after yoga. If you\u2019re completely depleted, it can actually have the opposite effect.\u201d\n\nLMNT has been a favorite of her students, too. \u201cWe don\u2019t sell a lot of products, but LMNT just flies out the door. Our students love them.\u201d\n\nWant to support your customers or clients with healthy hydration?
