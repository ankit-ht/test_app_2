We\u2019ve got the secrets \u2b07\ufe0f\n\nIf you\u2019ve got thinning hair, this can be caused by wax build up preventing nutrition from reaching the follicle. This wax can\u2019t be dissolved by using water, but it can be dissolved by using oil. \n\nOr, do you have brittle hairs in your lashes or brow that won\u2019t curl or fall in line with your other hairs? This means the oil gland at the root of the hair has dried up, leaving your lash or brow hair brittle and dry \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAt @bombaybeautyco, we\u2019ve developed a Brow & Lash Rejuvenator to clean & clear your hair probs with nutrient-rich, plant-based oils.
