  "caption": "Sweet Pitti deodorant cream eliminates odor-causing bacteria while absorbing excess moisture from the skin. Our founder, Tiffany Masterson, applies it by putting it in the palm of her hand and massaging it into her armpits (this is also a great opportunity to check for lumps!).\n\nWhile many deodorants use baking soda, Sweet Pitti does not. Baking soda can be sensitizing, and repeated exposure can disrupt our skin's healthy pH, actually causing more bacteria and odor. Instead, we use mandelic acid because it\u2019s an effective and gentle antibacterial that won\u2019t disrupt the acid mantle of our underarms.",
