Our Siete chefs will be sampling this delicious Ma\u00edz Locos recipe made with our Mexican Street Corn Tortilla Chips and our Taco Seasoning Corn Tortilla Chips. Inspired by snacks we love to grab from Mexican snack shops, we created this dish just in time for you to enjoy this summer (and at Hot Luck, of course \ud83d\ude09)!\n\nSnag tickets TODAY at the link in our bio!
