It\u2019s how we heal the land, nourish people, and fight climate change\u2014all through the food we grow and eat. Every brand in this coalition has earned its place\u2014through verified sourcing, regenerative practices, and partnerships with farmers that prioritize soil health, biodiversity, and long-term resilience.\n\nWhen you support regenerative brands, you\u2019re investing in a food system that gives back more than it takes.\n\nWe\u2019re proud to be part of this movement\u2014and to work alongside other brand leaders from diverse paths doing the hard work to restore ecosystems, support farmers, and produce nutritious food.\n\u2028#IHeartRegen #RegenBrandsCoalition #RegenerativeAgriculture #SoilHealth #EatForChange",
