It\u2019s finally happening :)\n\nOver ten years ago, when we started our Instagram account, there was no such thing as a \u201ccreator\u201d, social media was early and the travel industry for many years after did not take me or BD seriously.\n\nNow, thanks to all of you, that\u2019s very different.\n\nTens of millions of people globally follow our channels (I still find this so crazy!) hundreds of creators build exciting careers with us- doing what they love & expressing themselves whilst traveling, and the travel industry is partnering with us in a massive way.\n\nBeautiful Destinations has become a fantastic business, profitable and growing fast, leading content innovation and marketing in our industry. We\u2019re very proud of that.\n\nBut we\u2019re just getting started :)\n\nWith our partners @visit.dubai we are building something truly special, the world\u2019s first creator training program in partnership with an official Tourism board, \u2018The Beautiful Destinations Academy, Powered by Dubai\u2019 and we\u2019d love you to be involved.\n\nDo you have the skills or interest to be a mentor at the BD Academy? (we move you to Dubai and pay you!) Do you have friends who could apply to be part of the program? Do you have ideas for how we could get the word out more? Or ideas about anything else? I\u2019m all ears!\n\nWe want to raise the game again in travel so please get in touch if you\u2019d like to join us.\n\nThanks\nJ\n\n#BDAcademy #VisitDubai #MyDubai",
