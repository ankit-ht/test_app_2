Our shampoo bars contain zero parabens and sulfates, and instead are made of ingredients you can actually read. (Coconut oil, kaolin clay, sunflower oil, and lots of essential oils!) \n\nTraditional shampoos are harsh on your hair, causing product buildup and can damage not only your hair but also your scalp. Our shampoo bars work to remove product buildup, and help your scalp and hair to be its happy healthy self. \ud83d\udc9b\n\n#shampoobar #shampoobars #switchtoshampoobars #organicessentialoils #readthelabel #ditchparabens #ditchsulfates #scalpcare",
