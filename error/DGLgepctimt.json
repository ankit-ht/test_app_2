At night, I dream about becoming a champion one day and the hard work that I need to continue doing. After I wake up my day begins as soon as I put on my HOKA trainers and hit the road.\n\nAs soon as I start running, I have a great sense of freedom and wellbeing, and any anxiety that I sometimes feel from being autistic, disappears. You are now halfway through your #Bondi9Challenge. I hope that the challenge has been great for your health and wellness.\n\nI believe in you.
