Enjoy. \n\nSometimes things work until they don\u2019t work anymore, and it\u2019s OK to pivot and try something new. \n\nThis was inspired by a phone call I had with a former client. Her child was clearly sending the message that she did not want to be bounced to sleep anymore, and when her mom gave her the space to fall asleep on her own, she did it without any crying whatsoever!\n\nMaybe you have been adamantly against independent sleep, but your child is sending clear messages that they are ready for it. It\u2019s OK to change direction.\n\nTo be fair, I have also seen children clearly sending the message that they are not ready for independent sleep, and that is OK too. \n\nThere is no reason to struggle through something that is clearly causing more stress for your family than it is good.\n\nIf your child might be demonstrating signs that they are ready to sleep on their own, but you don\u2019t even know how to begin doing that, send me a message or comment and we can discuss the ways we can work together!\n \n#parenting #motherhood #momlife #exhaustedmom #ineedsleep #exhaustedparwnt #sleepdeprived #newmom",
