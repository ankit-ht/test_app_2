  "caption": "Visited Turin with mom and sis \ud83e\udd0d\nShe wanted to see Venaria Reale and so I brought her, and while she marveled at the white vaults for the first time I reminisced how I had the entire location closed off for a day for one of my shootings.\nThen we went to the Egyptian museum, and as she marveled at the ancient statues I reminisced how I was the first fashion photographer to ever shoot in the most important temples of Luxor and the tomb of Nefertari, the most exquisitely conserved tomb in ancient history, a place that accepts visits of merely 15 minutes a day. The things I\u2019ve done, the places I\u2019ve seen.\nI will never take it for granted. I really lived a life worth of a movie and I owe it to you Mamma, the first to ever believe in me, when you first saw me from across the livingroom at 15 and said \u2018 you really catch fire when you have the camera in your hands \u2018 \n\ud83d\udcf8\nI love you.",
