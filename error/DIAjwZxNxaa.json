He reflected on the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement, the fight for economic justice, and the promise of a better future. His words on economic power and collective action still resonate today.\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udcac \u201cWe've got to strengthen Black institutions. I call upon you to take your money out of the banks downtown and deposit your money in Tri-State Bank\u2014we want a \u2018bank-in\u2019 movement in Memphis.\u201d\u2060\n\u2060\nDr. King understood that economic empowerment was key to liberation. He urged Black communities to invest in their own financial institutions, boycott businesses that exploited Black workers, and build collective economic strength. His message is a reminder that where we spend and invest our money is a powerful tool for change.\u2060\n\u2060\nLess than 24 hours later, he was assassinated, but his words and mission live on. Dr. King's vision for justice, equality, and economic empowerment remains as powerful and necessary as ever. #BlackExcellence",
