The result: new Imax film cameras that are 30% quieter, significantly lighter, and backed by faster scanning and processing for quicker access to dailies. \u201cIf you can solve the problems, I\u2019ll shoot the whole thing in Imax,\u201d Nolan told Imax CEO Rich Gelfond. Now that promise is coming to life.\n\nThe new camera system is currently reserved for The Odyssey, but Imax plans to make the gear available to other directors after Nolan finishes the film. Interest is already surging, with a record number of films in 2025 either using Imax cameras or filming specifically for the format\u2014including Sinners, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning, and Formula One starring Brad Pitt.\n\n#pubity #film",
