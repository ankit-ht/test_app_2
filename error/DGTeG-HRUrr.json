He\u2019s a very interesting and friendly guy, and it\u2019s always fun to try to pick the brain of such a high level performer.  Thank you also to my brother @tonyhinchcliffe for sitting in with us.  Tony loves chess, so it was a big treat for him as well.  Podcast available now on @spotify and everywhere else!",
