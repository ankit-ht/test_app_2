The Elemental Diet:  A restrictive diet that replaces food and drinks with liquid or powder formulas that are easy to digest and provide a complete nutritional profile. The formulas break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates into their basic building blocks, such as amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars, and combine them with vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes. Check out @elementaldiet\n\n2. The Low Fermentation Diet: A restrictive diet that aims to help people with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or irritable bowel syndrome. The diet limits fermentable carbohydrates that can feed bacteria. It also includes meal timing guidelines to allow the gut to empty out between meals. Check out @goodlfeofficial @mastprogram \n\n3. The Low FODMAP Diet: A restrictive diet that limits foods that contain fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). FODMAPs are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed by the small intestine and ferment in the colon.

Here's to a healthy microbiome! \n\n#WorldMicrobiomeDay #GutHealth #SIBO #IBS #HealthyEating #ElementalDiet #LowFermentationDiet #LowFODMAPDiet",
