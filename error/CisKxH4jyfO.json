  "caption": "We have to keep the conversation going surrounding reproductive health and reproductive justice in a post Roe world and consider the impacts on nursing practice and healthcare as a whole. With laws changing daily and varying across state lines, there is a lot of conflicting and confusing information that nurses and patients have to sort through. Nurses need to know what the facts are so they can better serve patient communities and protect them through knowledge and education. \n\nThrough a collaborative effort with legal experts, nurses and community members @connectrnapp is showing how they treat nurses beyond their shifts, by providing nurses with crucial resources and tools on how to navigate a post Roe landscape. I\u2019ve  added a link in my bio where you can access these exclusive resources. \n\n.\n.\n.\n#sponsored #nurse #roevwade #reproductivejustice #reproductiverights #connectrn #nursing #shesinscrubs #nurselife #healthcare",
