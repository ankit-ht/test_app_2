Besides 12-hour wear, cloud-like comfort, and the fact that it\u2019s designed to reduce cramps, here are 2 more reasons this disc shines:\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83e\udd0f Insertion Notch: Our patented notch not only makes it easier to fold the disc, but it also creates a leading edge (a narrower point) for perfect placement during insertion. An easy, smooth, and comfy process.\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udcaf Non-slip Rim: During removal, the non-slip rim makes it super easy to grip and pull the disc out.\u2060 \n\u2060\nWhether you're a first-timer or a seasoned pro, our disc is here to make your period easier and more comfortable. \u2728 \u2060\n\nP.S. Did we mention it holds up to 6+ super tampons of blood? That\u2019s 70mL! \ud83d\ude2e\n\u2060\n#OnMyPeriod #PeriodTalk #MenstrualDisc #ReusableDisc101 #PeriodMadeEasy",
