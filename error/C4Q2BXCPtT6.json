In her day, Vietnamese women didn\u2019t have much opportunity / economic mobility, especially if not born into affluent families. \u00d4ng N\u1ed9i, or our grandfather, was a general in the Vietnam War, so she was left to take care of the family during some truly harrowing war times.\n\nB\u00e0 N\u1ed9i is the strongest woman we know \u2014 and while we have a tricky relationship with this narrative of the relentlessly \u201cstrong Vietnamese woman,\u201d we continue to be inspired by her discipline + dedication. B\u00e0 N\u1ed9i is the reason we (and Omsom) exist in the world today \ud83e\udde1\n\nSome fun facts about B\u00e0 N\u1ed9i:\n\u2638\ufe0f She now lives in southern California, where she remains committed to her Buddhist faith + regularly donates to her local temples.\n\ud83e\udea1 She is a really talented sewist (which @kimoftheinternet takes after).\n\ud83d\udcad Papa Pham considers her to be very progressive, because of how hands off she was with raising us \ud83d\ude0b\n\nHope y\u2019all are able to take stock today of whose shoulders you stand on \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd We love you, B\u00e0 N\u1ed9i!",
