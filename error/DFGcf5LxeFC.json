Remaining consistent with a healthy challenge and checking in with my online community helps me see my goals through. Last year, I felt this way after returning to running after having surgery in the middle of my marathon training season. I wasn't certain how my body would respond to exercise post-hysterectomy. Instead of trying to hammer through all of the miles that I missed while recovering, I adjusted my schedule accordingly. I prioritized moving slowly, steadily, and safely to reach finish lines. After finishing my fall race calendar, I promised myself that I'd dedicate these winter months to building up my foundation and moving like a well-oiled machine. Allow my experience to serve as a testament to stray away from the laundry list of what ifs, listen to your body, remain consistent, and focus on the miles in front of you.\n\n#Bondi9Challenge #HOKA #FlyHumanFly",
