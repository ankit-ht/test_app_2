The risks are high and the rules were made clear. But lines were drawn to be crossed and this is a season when reality bends to the will of romance and all logic and sensibility disappears. The inspiration for this collection of images initially came from some very entertaining observations I made along the Italian and French rivieras of playful encounters between sharp men in uniform and delightful well heeled female tourists. The handsome Carabinieri, the athletic first officer of the megayacht, the young tanned bellhop and of course the chiseled Napolitan waiter in Capri, these wonderful men are powerless under the spell of an attractive lady dripping in diamonds, drowned in Number 5 and ready for an off side summer romance. The wedding ring is buried in the safe of the Ritz, the husband is still in New York and her hands are free to bring temptation and a whirlwind of drama and lust to her prey. With jobs on the line and concerned lovers asking their whereabouts there is no turning back. Sometimes lust takes the helm and we are powerless to our own course!\n\nWould you take the chance!? Enjoy the summer! \n\n#fineart #yacht #summer #vacations #romance #riviera #mediterranean #tonykellyworld",
