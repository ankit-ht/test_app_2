We\u2019re grateful for the care and encouragement.\n\nWe\u2019re here through next month, and we\u2019re not slowing down. We\u2019ll be running programs and hosting events for New Mainers right up until our final day.\n\nOn June 3, we\u2019re offering a free workshop for immigrant women thinking about starting a business. If you\u2019ve been wondering where to begin, this is a great first step.\n\nTap the link in our bio to register. \n\nMore events to come soon!",
