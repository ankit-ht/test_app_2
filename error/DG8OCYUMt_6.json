That\u2019s why we\u2019re working to create real change by developing solutions that give women the tools and information they need to make informed choices about their health.\n\nWe believe that a future where every woman has the knowledge and options to take charge of her health is a future worth investing in. And #TeamBayer is all in! Together, we\u2019re driving impact and innovation for all, always focused on our mission: Health for all. Hunger for none. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc96 \n\n#AccelerateAction #IWD202 #WomensHealth",
