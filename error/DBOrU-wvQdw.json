Psychotherapy has historically focused on the individual personal ego while largely ignoring social conditions & collective currents. This assumption, that we are each limited in our ability to change social conditions, but can change our individual responses and adaptations to them, amplifies the colonialist shadow in our profession: that the individual ego is where all the action is at, and that our role as practitioners is in strictly in supporting the individual self/ego, while ignoring social conditions.\n\nJoin Gabor Mate\u0301 M.D. for a Live Talk & short Q&A, as he challenges this mythology of psychotherapy as simply an individual pursuit amidst current events. Global systems of hierarchy, inequity and power enter our room in every session. As therapists, what is our responsibility in engaging it, while respecting each individual self?\n\nDr Mate\u0301 shows that one can take a principled position without rancor to either side in a conflict, that we can support collective healing, speak up for humanity and advocate for a world where the psyche is nurtured as part of a holistic ecosystem.\n\nThis event is hosted by Therapists 4 Palestine. We are committed to a free Palestine and all liberatory movements extending from Turtle Island to across the globe. We recognize and seek to dismantle the interconnected and systemic nature of racism, colonization, and all oppressions \u2014 particularly the complicity of the mental health field in these harms. We strive to do our part in moving towards liberation.",
