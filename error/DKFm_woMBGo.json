Or stretch marks or face acne.\n\nWouldn\u2019t you be tired if you were creating life from scratch\nwhile holding down a job and pretending everything\u2019s fine?\n\nHere\u2019s the truth:\nMost women go into pregnancy depleted, under-muscled, and overwhelmed.\nNo one teaches us to train for this.\nBut athletes do.\n\nThey fuel.\nThey prep.\nThey recover with intention.\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how we should be treating pregnancy too.\n\nBecause whether you\u2019re pregnant, postpartum, or just navigating hormones like a boss\u2014\n\nYou are an ultra-endurance athlete in disguise.\n\nYou deserve deep nourishment,\nactual rest,\nand way more respect than a \u201care you sure it\u2019s not twins?\u201d\n\nplease remember how important muscle is\u2026 I won\u2019t whether you want me to share a little bit more about the journey!",
