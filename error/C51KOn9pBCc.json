  "caption": "Somewhere along the way, suede got a reputation for being more delicate and less durable than top grain leather. Well, sometimes that can be true, but we\u2019re here to tell you that you can still kick ass in suede on your back or on your feet. \n\nThe difference is that we use HEAVY duty (1.6-1.8mm) rough out suede which, like the name implies, is made to be roughed up! Our engineer and service boots are now available in two new spring colors, Sienna and Olive. \n\nThis Texas suede is heavily oiled which gives it protection against the weather so you don\u2019t need to baby these...ever. The oil darkens the color of the suede and as they are worn and broken in, the color will shift and evolve. You\u2019ll see lighter golden brown undertones shining through and as the leather creases the suede will show that unique-to-you patina that shows you\u2019ve put them through the wringer. \n\nAs always, they\u2019re made in the USA with the most durable construction using a Goodyear welt, Vibram soles and a fiberglass shank for lightweight stability.",
