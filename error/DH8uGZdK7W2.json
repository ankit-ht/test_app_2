The moment I arrived for my stay, he opened the door and told me he knew my name and why I was there. He proceeded to tell me the history of where I was at, ensuring I knew I was at the epicenter of Black history\u2019s past, present, and future (and that it was up to me to carry the baton). He gave me so many gems and knowledge, and by the end of the stay he told me I\u2019m his new honorary granddaughter \ud83d\ude2d\" - @imyagirleva\u2060\n\u2060\nFollow @officialblackwallstreet for more Black excellence and Black-owned businesses.",
