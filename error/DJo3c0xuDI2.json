Their latest grant of $50,000 supports us in preparing and delivering Medically Tailored Meals to individuals in the New York area living with HIV/AIDS.\n \nCommunity support is vital to our mission and reflected in the communities we serve. God\u2019s Love originates from supporting individuals in NYC marginalized and stigmatized due to illness, as founder Ganga Stone demonstrated by delivering our first meal to her friend dying from HIV/AIDS at the height of the AIDS pandemic in New York City.\n \nBroadway Cares supports organizations which provide services for people affected by HIV/AIDS and their families. Broadway Cares is helping us reach our goal of serving over 90,000 meals annually to individuals living with HIV/AIDS and their families.\n \nWe are grateful for the longstanding partnership we have with Broadway Cares, dating back over 30 years.\n\n#TheaterAndPhilanthopy #BroadwayCares #FoodIsLove #FoodIsMedicine",
