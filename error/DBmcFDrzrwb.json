  "caption": "Honestly I don\u2019t really know what to caption this post. I wanted to say \u201cbody changes throughout the year\u201d but it actually means a lot more to me than that. There were moments this year where I felt really ashamed of my body, (for example when I had to wear form fitting tennis clothes lol). I was also constantly struggling with this overwhelming urge to \u201csnapback\u201d, seeing other mom\u2019s seemingly shrink immediately after having their baby was an expectation I began to put on myself. That self comparison always hurt because I felt as an athlete I should be losing weight quicker than most, I was in the gym everyday so that thought didn\u2019t feel too unrealistic. Most weeks would feel similar to the previous week and the weight didn\u2019t disappear overnight so it was a bit disheartening. To get to the point I\u2019m at now was definitely a journey, an adventure I know that I\u2019m still embracing. All bodies are different and I appreciate mine for how it is. My body has done so much for me and adapted so well to the tasks that I\u2019m asking from it, I\u2019m extremely grateful and thankful. While typing this I realized that if I had to title this post it would be super long and go like- \u201cthank you body for the journey over the past year, I\u2019m excited to learn more about what you\u2019re capable of in the years to come \u2764\ufe0f\u201d haha.",
