I\u2019m so excited to be taking these two products during this launch! \n\n\ud83e\udde0 Focus by @evohemp is helping me with the massive amounts of editing I\u2019m doing over here. Turning multiple 90 minute workshops into 15+ easy to consume videos takes time AND focus! \n\n\ud83d\udc86\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Immune by @evohemp + intention + listening to my body is going to prevent me from feeling under the weather after this launch. I even booked a 2 hour massage right after my workshop and then I fly to Puerto Rico 2 days later to relax and rejuvenate! \n\n\ud83e\udd73 When @evohemp reached out to see if I wanted to try their products I read their story and it was an immediate hell yes! \n\n\ud83c\udf31They source their hemp from a Minnesota based and farmer owned cooperative focusing on bringing equity and innovation to Black, Indigenous and other socially disadvantaged farmers. \n\n\ud83c\udf1eThe co-op also teaches members the basics of sustainable farming to help regenerate the soil and reduce climate damage.\n\n\u2728 Go check them out!",
