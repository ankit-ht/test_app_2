Under the rule, attorneys may not divulge their clients' secrets, nor may others force them to. The purpose of the privilege is to encourage clients to openly share information with their lawyers and to let lawyers effectively represent their clients.\n\nMake sure your attorney does run off at the mouth before hiring them! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffe",
