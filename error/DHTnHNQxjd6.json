This sacred space serves as a reflection of the shift in nature; where day and night stand in perfect harmony, reminding us to embrace new beginnings and fresh opportunities.\n\nIncorporate elements that symbolize Air, Fire, Water, Earth & Spirit. You\u2019re setting intentions, meditating, or performing a ritual, your altar becomes a powerful focal point for manifesting change.\n\nPlease take the altar suggestions if they resonate and align, and prepare yourself to welcome in the Spring Equinox this week. \u2728\n\nHow are you preparing to welcome this new season of light and transformation?\n\n#springequinox #springritual #altar #ceremony #springtime #seasonalliving #rituals",
