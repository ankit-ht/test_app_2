The epic beauty of this airport which reads more like a temple was just an introduction to an entire country\u2019s emphasis on material beauty signifying devotion to God. \n\nAnd after a decade of dreaming of this perfect country whose spirituality is at the forefront of its existence, I was so excited to visit the parliamentary Zhongs which are always 3/4 monastery, where government officials work alongside monks.  To meet the team and learn about the upcoming Gelephu Mindfullness City @gmcbhutan , where @kingjigmekhesar \nis planning a futuristic city where ethical capitalism can co-exist with nature. \n\nI even found some equanimous perfection in a monk answering his cell phone in the middle of my blessing ceremony or even people making tik tok\u2019s at the temple. The serenity of a country without billboards, traffic lights, or noise pollution made me realize the chaos we have all become accustomed to.  And on the flipside humanity cannot live without its transgressions.  You can go through religious ceremony repeatedly but still be devoid of spiritual grace.  So grateful for this heart mind and soul opening experience!  Thank you BHUTAN",
