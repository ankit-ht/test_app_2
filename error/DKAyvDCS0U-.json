A collaboration between Jones Boer Architects,\u00a0@banksdevelopment, and\u00a0@arentzla\u00a0united three of the city\u2019s most significant long-standing industry names in meticulously handcrafting a home whose proportions, materials, and workmanship harken back to a bygone era.\n\nProminently perched on the site of the renowned Cafritz Mansion, the rare, nearly 39,000 square-foot lot enables a gracious crescent drive and separate motor court, affording a resplendent approach to the grand estate. Unobstructed forward vistas overlook verdant parkland and soaring mature trees. Painstaking studies of distinguished local mansions and the works of John Russell Pope were scrutinized for their scale, proportions, and details.\n\nIn the rear, a wide loggia bridges the relationship between indoor and outdoor spaces. A harmonious blend of minimalist landscaping and extensive limestone hardscaping creates a natural oasis, completely removed from the urban environment beyond.\u00a0\n\nA four-car garage, industrial-grade support systems, including geothermal HVAC, 800-amp electrical service, a full house generator, Savant automation with audio-visual capabilities, and a comprehensive Lutron lighting suite, add layers of modern livability. As one of the finest estates in the Capital Region, 3030 Chain Bridge Road NW will undoubtedly be immortalized among Washington\u2019s most distinguished homes.\n____\n\n12,911 Sqft | 8 Beds | 13 Baths\u00a0\n\nVisit 3030ChainBridge.com to learn more.\u00a0\n____\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n#realestate\u00a0#estate\u00a0#mansion\u00a0#luxuryrealestate\u00a0#washingtondc",
