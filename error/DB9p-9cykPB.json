Just had the time of my life with 207,000 beautiful people in Indianapolis who showered us with so much love and excitement and joy\u2026 I know I\u2019ll be looking back on this weekend and smiling because it was just like a dreamscape, all of it. Thank you to everyone who came out to see us on our last 3 American shows!! And here\u2019s a friendly but extremely important reminder that tomorrow is the US Election and your last chance to vote. \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \nThere are only 9 shows left on The Eras Tour. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re in single digits \ud83e\udd72 Next up: getting to finally see my beloved Canadian fans again!! See you \ud83d\udd1c for 6 shows in Toronto!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7: @kevinmazur / @gettyimages / TAS Rights Management",
