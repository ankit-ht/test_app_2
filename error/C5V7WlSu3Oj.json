Where\u2019s the weirdest place you\u2019ve made breakfast?\n\nThe last 7+ years living on the road we\u2019ve realized how much we\u2019ve enjoyed staying in casino parking lots. They always have security, usually pretty level parking, lots of food and beverage options, and the nights are quiet. This particular one even has a dump and water fill so we can easily shower and fill/empty our tanks when needed.\n\nFollow @beerving_america \ud83d\ude90 \ud83c\udf73 \ud83c\udfb0 \n\n#rvlife #rvliving #fulltimerv #vanlife #vanlifehack #vanlifetravel #homeonwheels #homeiswhereyouparkit #tinyhomeonwheels #breakfast #breakfastideas",
