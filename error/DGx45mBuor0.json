The Atlanta location has been a long time coming, and ACS was aware of its pending opening going back to May 2021. The pandemic plans fell through, but the company pushed on and opened its doors in the ATL in late February 2025. The Atlanta location was worth waiting for \u2014 it is For Five\u2019s biggest caf\u00e9 by square footage (3,700 s.f.) across 30+ stores and represents a new flagship in Atlanta and the Southeast.\n\nThe interior features a modern aesthetic and a hotel-like lobby/interior. There is plenty of seating across the bar area, individual, and communal tables. Free Wi-Fi is available, and the coffee shop is open 7AM to 7PM daily. With this new ATL location, For Five is elevating every detail in a caf\u00e9 experience.\n\nAs for coffee: the espresso here is Roc Center Espresso blend from @forfive (a blend of Brazilian, Colombian, and Indonesian coffee beans; tasting notes of lemon zest and cocoa).\n\nA must-order on the coffee menu is the Freddo Cappuccino\u2014get it iced\u2014as that is a rare item to see on a coffee menu in Atlanta. \n\nThe coffee shop also features a full assortment of pastries and a lunch menu\u2014these would be worth exploring over multiple days in Midtown\u2014as well as a popular stuffed cookie \ud83c\udf6a menu (IYKYK). \n\nSwipe through this set to see the ACS Instagram preview of For Five Coffee Atlanta.
