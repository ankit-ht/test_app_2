When I came across the @whodecideswar collection I knew it was going to be the perfect stage piece. A subtle nod but a iykyk. This was the craziest set to witness and I\u2019m so grateful to call this work! Big thanks to the team!! Can\u2019t wait to do it again \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc",
