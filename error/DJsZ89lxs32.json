He paid the ultimate price for sinners like you and me. Bible Verse Of The Day \u271e\n\nLove is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.\n\n1 Corinthians 13:4-8\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n#dallas #dfw #luxury #luxurylifestyle  #hometour #housetours #luxuryrealestate #newconstruction",
