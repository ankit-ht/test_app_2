When my father left his toy business after fleeing Iran in the late 70\u2019s, he came to LA where an acquaintance was in the eyewear business. That world raised us.  One day I would be in his office putting glasses in bags, the next day Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard was in my living room modeling for my brother\u2019s line while I was wearing the kid\u2019s collection.  All I have is love for my family and the city that took us in.  You can be whoever you want to be in LA.",
