Your Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) is your gut\u2019s built-in cleaning cycle. Every 90-120 minutes between meals, it sweeps out undigested food and bacteria with cleaning waves to keep your small intestine fresh. But if your MMC isn\u2019t working properly (due to stress, infections, or slow motility), bacteria can stick around and overgrow\u2014leading to SIBO or Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or feeling \u201cbacked up\u201d after eating, your gut\u2019s \"dishwasher\" might not be working properly. \ud83c\udf00\ud83d\udeab \n\n\u2705 The Trio-Smart at-home breath test is the only test that can check for all 3 gases associated with bacterial overgrowth: Hydrogen, Methane, and Hydrogen Sulfide.\n\n#TMYK #SIBOBreathTest #SmallIntestinalBacterialOvergrowth #GutHealth #SIBO #Digestion #athomebreathtest #breathtest #MigratingMotorComplex #CleaningWaves #MMC #TrioSmart",
