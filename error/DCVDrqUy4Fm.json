It\u2019s ignited by an interplay of factors\u2014biological, psychological, and even social.\n\nLibido can shift for a variety of reasons, such as exhaustion, anxiety, certain medications, and pregnancy. But hidden health issues can also be the cause, including:\n-Chronic stress\n-Nutrient deficiencies\n-Hormonal imbalances\n-Thyroid issues\n-Autoimmune conditions\n-Diabetes\n-Kidney disease\n\nIt\u2019s not just being busy or getting older.
