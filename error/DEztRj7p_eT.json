Their pursuit of excellence mirrors our own, exploring how artistry and authenticity can intersect in ways that resonate beyond our borders.\n\nWe caught up with Alyssa Alikpala, a multidisciplinary artist whose work navigates the tension between art and design. Guided by an exploration of materials and environments, her process blends research, experimentation, and the ephemeral qualities of organic forms. Born in Vancouver and based in Toronto, Alyssa\u2019s perspective is shaped by the natural landscapes of her youth and the urban architecture she now calls home.\n\nDiscover the full interview with Alyssa through the link in our bio.\n@alyssaalikpala\n\nPhotos by @jeremymarasigan",
