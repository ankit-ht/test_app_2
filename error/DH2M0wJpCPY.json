Despite the challenges, the Kings have embraced their mission with grace and passion. Now pastoring Carlsbad Apostolic Church this beautiful couple and their three boys are faithfully serving the people God has placed in their care.\n\nThey love God deeply, work tirelessly, and are committed to helping others know Jesus. We\u2019ve had a wonderful time here facilitating a marriage retreat and Family Sunday, and I am so impressed with this amazing family. I thank God for their dedication.  https://carlsbadapostolicchurch.com/",
