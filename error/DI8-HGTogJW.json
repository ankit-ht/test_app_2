I feel like I failed you\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult year, physically and mentally very tough, but one day I was clear: \u2018until my legs don\u2019t give up anymore\u2019. This club doesn\u2019t deserve less\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be back, we\u2019ll continue and there I\u2019ll be leaving everything for the respect Madrid deserves, its people and everything that involves playing in the most winning team in history. Thank you\u201d.",
