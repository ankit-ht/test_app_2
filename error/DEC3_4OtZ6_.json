  "caption": "After weeks of bombardment from the Houthis in Yemen, the IDF said enough is enough and has now taken off the gloves. \n\nIsrael has confirmed that it launched widespread attacks across Yemen in response to the Houthi\u2019s terror. \n\nThis is the beginning of an ongoing campaign to stop the firing of drones and ballistic missiles into Israel. \n\nSo far, the results of Israel\u2019s attack in Yemen:\n \n1. Sana\u2019a Airport \u2013 Completely shut down.\n2. Power Plants in Sana\u2019a \u2013 Destroyed.\n3. Hodeidah Seaport \u2013 Shut down once again.\n\nThis is all happening during the press conference of the Houthi leader.\n\nAttacks at the airport include the control tower, planes, and runways, were attacked, resulting in several casualties. \n\nIsrael is expecting the Houthis to intensify their attacks now on Israel but the Israeli leadership said this is the beginning of a long operation. \n\nIs this the beginning of the end of the Houthi\u2019s? Let\u2019s hope so.",
