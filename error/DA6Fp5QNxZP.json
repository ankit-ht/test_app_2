Just over three hours from Boston, this jewel of the northeastern United States is a quick escape from the big city. From New York City, it\u2019s a day\u2019s drive \u2014 about seven hours. If your starting point is the Enterprise rental counter at Portland International Jetport, you can be in Camden in just over 90 minutes.\" \ud83d\udcf8: @michaelciaglo\n\n#Enterprise #RoadTrip #Maine #FallRoadTrip",
