  "caption": "On October 16, 1887, a Denver woman, priest, two ministers and a rabbi came together because they believed there was a better way to meet the needs of local residents. They founded the Charity Organization Society, now known as United Way. We've had many names over the years but one mission: to build communities where all can thrive. Thank you for 137 years of support. We owe so much to our donors, volunteers and partners. #LiveUnited",
