Whether you\u2019re raising littles, loving bonus kids, guiding from afar, or showing up with a listening ear and a warm hug, you are making a difference.\n\nWe see you. We appreciate you. And today, we celebrate you! \ud83d\udc9d\n\nHappy Mother\u2019s Day to the mamas, the stepmoms, the grandmas, the aunties, the mentors, and every woman who shows up with love like a mother. You deserve all the rest, all the love, and every pampered moment.\n\nlove, Erica\n\n#mommani #ericasata #mothersday #nailtech",
