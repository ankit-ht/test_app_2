Disturbances in mucosal lining, microbiome dysbiosis, overgrowth of bacteria in small intestines, can all appear as rashes, flares, or even the onset of skin diseases such as acne, eczema, or psoriasis. \n\nImbalance of the intestinal microbiome can cause excess bacterial growth of pathobionts, leading to competition for nutrients and toxic metabolite production. This results in local and systemic inflammation affecting the physiology of the skin. Maintaining the integrity of tight junctions and the permeability of intestinal epithelial cells is crucial.\n\nThere is a link between the gut microbiome and eczema, and some research suggests that changes to the gut microbiome may be a factor in the development of eczema.  This imbalance may contribute to the inflammation and immune responses that are implicated in eczema.\n\nA study found that the gut microbiome of infants with eczema differed from that of healthy infants. The study found that pathogenic species such as Escherichia, Shigella or Clostridium were more abundant in infants with eczema, while the species Bifidobacterium was more abundant in healthy infants [1].\n\nEating a plant-based, anti-inflammatory diet may help some people with eczema. Eating fermented foods while pregnant may reduce the risk of a child developing eczema [2].\n\nReferences:\n1.\thttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5094743/\n2.\thttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/eczema-gut-health#\n\n#codexlabs #biohacking #biotechnology #bioscience #skincare #eczema #guthealth #probiotics #microbiome",
