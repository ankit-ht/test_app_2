Our key focus is on empowering women to be financially independent through employment. \u2060\n\u2060\nOur mission is to empower women to have choices to help build a life full of passion and purpose, whatever that may be. We are firm believers that employment is the key to financial independence, and financial independence provides freedom of choice. Our belief in female support doesn\u2019t stop at those already within our walls. We extend the offer through a pioneering employment program: The Encoreship. \u2060\n\u2060\nOnly 32% of mothers feel confident enough to re-enter the workforce (Get Qualified, 2016), and only 59% of mature age women (55 \u2013 65 years) keep at it, compared to 72% of mature age men (Australian Government Women\u2019s Workforce Participation, 2020). To us, that\u2019s unacceptable, and highlights the undeniable inequalities prevalent in the workplace. With initiatives like The Encoreship, we can bridge that gap. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe Encoreship is a three-month paid placement for women facing challenges re-entering the corporate world (whatever that reason may be), with the sole purpose to help rebuild confidence, skills and support the transition back into the workforce, because everyone deserves to have a purpose-filled life. \u2060\n\u2060\nIn 2021, we welcomed our first inspiring and deserving woman into the program at DISSH, with 5 currently in our Encoreship Alumni. With a new year just getting started, we plan to do it all over again in 2025. \u2060\n\u2060\nSound like something you are interested in knowing more about? Reach out to PC@dissh.com.au and join our collective mission.\u2060\n\u2060\nMeet Lisa, our 2022 Encorer. \u2060\n#DISSH",
