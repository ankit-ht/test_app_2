Yet, we find ourselves in a crisis where nurses do not feel seen, heard, or valued. How do we change the conversation so this community can thrive and deliver the best care for us all? \n\nToday kicks off our conversation with @sarahedigregorio, author of \u201cTaking Care: The Story of Nursing and Its Power to Change Our World,\u201d a love letter to nurses in the form of a book. \n\nIn partnership with @thenursingbeat, we hope to shine a light on the power of nurses to heal and build community at the center of healthcare. \n\nTake a listen.\n\n#takingcare #takecareofnurses #nursesrule #listentonurses #nursepower #nursegratitude",
