Inspired by the dynamic energy of the city, particularly its diverse neighborhoods and the culture of the late \u201890s and early 2000s, Marcel\u2019s work reflects the city\u2019s multifaceted style, striking a balance between expression and functionality.\n\nDiscover the full interview with Marcel through the link in our bio.\n@Marcelpena_\n@asics_sportstyle \n\nPhotographer: @Derek.balarezo",
