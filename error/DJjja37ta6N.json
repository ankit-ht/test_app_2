  "caption": "The #AstonMartin Vantage Roadster shares all of its major mechanical components with the Coupe version. Power comes from an AMG twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, but this has been substantially reworked to increase peak output to 656 hp and 590 lb-ft.\n\nOn Aston\u2019s numbers, the Roadster is only 132 lbs more than the Coupe. Aston claims a 3.5-second 0-60-mph time, just a tenth behind the coupe, with both cars having an identical claimed 202-mph top speed. The company says the Roadster\u2019s power-operated fabric hood is the quickest on the market, able to open or close in just 6.8 seconds and operate at speeds of up to 31 mph.\n\n#2026 #VantageRoadster #roadster #sportscar #review #carsofinstagram #cargram #roadandtrack\nPhotos by @Andysnaps",
