  "caption": "When we created the design for this Florence apartment, we knew the kitchen needed to feel intimate, layered, and full of soul. Inspired by the tones of an 18th-century triptych, the palette brings softness and subtle contrast to a space where every detail tells a story. We\u2019re so honored to see it featured in the Winter 2025 issue of @milieumag! \n\nWant to see more from this project and explore our other design projects in Paris and Italy?
