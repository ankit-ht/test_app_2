In 2015, I went back, except this time, I didn\u2019t have to audition because I was on the jury of Lakm\u0113 Fashion Week. This past Sunday, the 30th of March 2025, I opened the Lakm\u0113 Fashion Week, 25yr Anniversary Grand Finale show, wearing none other than @taruntahiliani . \n.\nTo say I am humbled and grateful is no where close to saying enough. I am proud of me. I am thankful to God and the Universe for giving me the strength, endurance and patience to see my dreams come true. I am here to stay and I will never take the privilege of being in this industry for granted. \n.\nThere are so many thank yous to be said.
