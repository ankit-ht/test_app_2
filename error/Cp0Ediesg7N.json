BETTY FERRELL\n\nDr. Betty Ferrell, Ph.D., M.S.N., CHPN, is a highly regarded, published, and awarded nurse, whose lifelong work is dedicated to making hospice and palliative care an essential part of healthcare.\n\nWhen she began working as a nurse over 45 years ago, there were fewer than ten hospices in the US and palliative care was not widely known. But with the help of her efforts and numerous projects (including the End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium that she founded and led), palliative care has grown to be a global practice. \n\nShe currently serves as the Director of Nursing Research and Education and a professor at City of Hope in Southern California.\n\n#NoticeTheNurses #WomensHistoryMonth",
