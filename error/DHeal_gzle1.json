Led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., this march was a defining moment in the Civil Rights Movement, one that helped pave the way for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe road wasn\u2019t easy, but they marched anyway. They marched for justice, for equality, and for the generations that would come after them.\u2060\n\u2060\nToday, we honor their courage and their sacrifice. The fight for our rights didn\u2019t end in 1965, and it\u2019s on us to keep pushing forward. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe #BlackHistory\u2060\n\u2060\nFollow @officialblackwallstreet for more Black excellence and Black-owned businesses.",
