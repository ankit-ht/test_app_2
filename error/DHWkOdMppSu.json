That\u2019s why this Global Recycling Day, our social team dropped off their used ELEMIS faves @ultabeauty \u2019s @Pact_Collective bin.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to give your empties a second life: Use it up. Rinse it out. Drop it off.\n\n\u267b\ufe0f As a B Corp brand, we\u2019re committed to protecting biodiversity, positively impacting the climate and empowering our people and communities for a better future. Who\u2019s joining us in dropping off your empties this week?",
