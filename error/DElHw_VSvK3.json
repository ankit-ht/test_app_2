The 6 God revealed he\u2019s back in the studio as he turns the page to a clean slate in the new year.\u2060\n\u2060\nDrizzy took to social media for a colorful post as he got back to work while showing off his studio setup while rocking a crochet hat and baby blue silk top matching his Chrome Hearts travel bag.\u2060\n\u2060\n\u201cI thought this through,\u201d Drake captioned the post. Another photo also found him donning a money sign chain to go with his nails painted with the same symbol. The money signs have previously been hinting toward his upcoming collab album with PartyNextDoor, but the highly anticipated project remains without a release date.\u2060\n\u2060\nMore details on what the 6 God has in store is at the link in bio.\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udcf8 Norman Wong",
