It's an umbrella term encompassing technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) that aim to seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds. Imagine furniture appearing in your living room virtually to see if it fits or receiving repair instructions overlaid on a broken machine through your glasses. \n \nSpatial computing uses real-time spatial data and allows interaction with digital elements within our physical environment. The demand for spatial computing specialists, including AR/VR developers, 3D artists, and experienced designers, has surged by 45%, indicating a booming job market in this innovative field. \n \nReady to dive into the world of spatial computing?
