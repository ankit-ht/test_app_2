Our Research Initiative for Self-Care Equity shows that infants born into lower socioeconomic situations are 60% more likely to suffer from anemia because their moms often lack access to proper nutrition.\ud83e\udd30\ud83e\udd57\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all in with our #NutrientGapInitiative! By 2030, we aim to ensure that 50 million people in underserved communities have access to essential vitamins and minerals every year. Our activities range from supporting smallholder farmers who grow fresh fruits and veggies to advancing vital micronutrient supplementation. \ud83c\udf31\u2764\ufe0f\n\nTogether, we can empower communities to thrive, nurture healthier families, and create brighter futures for all.\n\n#HealthforAll #HungerForNone",
