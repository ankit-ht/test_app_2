I started thinking about a place that moves at a gentle pace, where the ceiling fans stir the air slowly and everywhere you look, palm fronds are swaying. This collection is an escape\u2014a trip to a land of palm trees, steel drums, endless beaches, and thoroughly glowing skin. Everyone is welcome in my vacationland, except of course, the Suspicious 6. And the rules here are simple: Listen to your skin, wear your sunscreen, and take care of yourself. And most importantly, whether you are getting on a plane or throwing on a robe for a spa night at home, have a wonderful holiday. \n\nXX, \nTiffany",
