  "caption": "\u201cWhen I started Willy Chavarria, my intention was gender fluidity. The industry, though, is still structured around gendered categories. When I design, I don\u2019t think about gender at all. My sketches are just a head, a circle and body made of straight lines \u2014 no [genitalia].\u201d \n \nCentring Latinx influences and gender fluidity in American fashion \u2014 recent years have cemented California-hailing ascendant @willychavarrianewyork as one of the world\u2019s most urgent, coveted design forces. Courted by A-list fans and with social messages more pressing than ever before, 10 years since his eponymous label\u2019s inception, it\u2019s crossing new frontiers on a regular basis. Covering our Spring/Summer 2025 issue, he talks his monumental January Paris Fashion Week debut, disregarding gender in the design process, marrying his West and East Coast histories and how Chicano culture defines his brand\u2019s DNA. Plus, he answers questions from a bevy of friends, fans and collaborators, including @kingofbingo, @juliafox, @leonbridges and @paoramos.
