Here are 3 hacks that have improved my performance over the yearsl:\n\n1. Intensity Control \u2026 Not every session should feel like a race. I structure my weeks with purpose, some days are high intensity, others are all about active recovery. \n\nLearning to manage effort has helped me peak at the right time, not burn out.\n\n2. Consistency Over Everything\u2026 Progress doesn\u2019t come from a few epic sessions. It\u2019s the daily grind\u2026 the early mornings, the cold water, the drills on repeat. Show up, even when it\u2019s tough. That\u2019s where the real edge is built.\n\n3. Technique First\u2026 Speed starts with form. I\u2019m constantly refining my stroke, sometimes with video analysis, sometimes with a coach\u2019s eye. Chasing efficiency in the water has been a bigger game-changer than any strength set.\n\nTrain smart. Race hard. Recover harder.\n\n#SwimLife #ProTips #SwimTraining #AthleteMindset #TechniqueMatters",
