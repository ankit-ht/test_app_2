Impact grows with empowerment. \n\nThe fundamental mission at @padsplit is to help solve the affordable housing shortage while leveraging housing as a vehicle for financial empowerment.\n\nPadSplit creates a scalable housing solution that aligns incentives between cities that desperately require affordable housing, property owners who seek a return on their investment, and local individuals who need quality housing close to their jobs.\n\nThis unity in incentives is what has led to over 1,000 affordable, all-inclusive housing units in Jacksonville within 18 months of launch. \n\nOn a national level, there have been over 15,000 units created in the last six years. This growth is only projected to accelerate as the need for affordable housing increases. \n\nOne mission. One room at a time. \n\nThank you to @marketingbullmedia and @jaxreia for this photo from November\u2019s monthly meeting.",
