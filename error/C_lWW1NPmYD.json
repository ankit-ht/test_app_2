The 1500-meter runner from Northern Arizona University was about to race Rivaldo Marshall of Iowa, the reigning NCAA indoor champion, in his first 800 of the season. \n\nThough it was a daunting match-up, some sage advice helped Colin shift his mindset. For the last two years, Colin\u2019s coach Mike Smith has reminded him to focus on competing against other runners, instead of going for a time on the track. In every race, the All-American practices ways to beat as many competitors as he can while trying not to focus on the clock. \u201c[Mike] helped me recognize that racing is more important than running fast, but if you race to win, fast times will eventually come with that,\u201d Colin says. \n\nThe strategy paid off in Tucson, Arizona. For two laps, Colin put himself in a position to win, and ultimately sprinted through the finish line in a 1:45.63 personal best, beating Rivaldo by almost a full second. The victory also set the tone for a breakthrough track season. \ud83d\ude80\n\nColin went on to finish fourth in the 1500 at the NCAA championships and compete through the semifinal at the U.S. Olympic Trials as one of the only collegians in a field of professionals. Looking back, Colin attributes a lot of his success to trusting his ability as a runner, something he hopes more athletes embrace as an important skill. \n\n\u201cView each competition as practice to learn from your competitors and from your own mistakes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more you practice the better decision you can make in competition later.\u201d \n\nThis fall, Colin is leading NAU into an exciting cross-country season in which the Lumberjacks return as the No. 4-ranked team in the country. On the track, Colin is aiming to win his first NCAA title and compete for a spot on Team USA headed to the 2025 world championships in Tokyo. \ud83d\ude4c\n\nJoin us in welcoming @colinsahlman as he competes for more big wins this season! \n\n\ud83d\udcf8 @nickisabella.photography \n\n#FlyHumanFly #HOKA #TeamHOKA",
