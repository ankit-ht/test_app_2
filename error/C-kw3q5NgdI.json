Listen as Judith discusses the highs, the lows and how running & the outdoors has helped to rebuild her confidence.\n\n\u201cI hope that my story can inspire women, it\u2019s important that all genders can take part in competition.\u201d\n\nDiscover more from Judith through the link in bio.\n\n#FlyHumanFly #HOKA #HOKAUTMBMontBlanc #MadeintheMountains",
