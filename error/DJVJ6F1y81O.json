The cause? Chairs that were carelessly placed near the pool by property management.\n\nWe argued that the owners and managers of the complex failed in their duty to keep the pool area safe \u2014 and we held them accountable.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If you\u2019ve been injured due to unsafe property conditions, you don\u2019t have to fight alone.\n\ud83d\udcde DM us or call for a free consultation. Let\u2019s talk about your rights.\n\n\ud83d\udcde818-477-0773\n\ud83d\udccd 15490 Ventura Blvd #205, Sherman Oaks, CA, 91403\n\ud83d\udcbb statelawfirm.com\n\n#personalinjurylawyers #happyclient #casestudy #settlements",
