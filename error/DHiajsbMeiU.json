The Great Lakes provide water for 40 million people in the USA and Canada but sadly, they\u2019re plagued by sewage, industrial waste, plastic pollution and toxic algae blooms.\n\nIf made law, the Great Lakes and State Waters Bill of Rights will recognise the legal rights of these vital bodies of water to \u201cexist, persist, flourish, naturally evolve, regenerate and be restored\u201d.\n\nThe latest version takes on board feedback from local communities and expands protection to all NY State waters. It includes treaty rights protections for Indigenous Peoples and Tribal Nations and empowers counties and municipalities to enact Rights of Nature laws.\n\nAs the Rights of Nature movement grows, US communities continue to campaign to recognise Nature\u2019s rights. The introduction of this bill at state level represents an important moment for this grassroots movement for change. \ud83d\udca6\ud83c\udf43\ud83c\udf0d\n\nImage Credit: Lake Erie | Shari Weinsheimer | CC0 1.0 Universal\n\n#GoodNewsforNaturesRights #RightsofNature #NaturesRights #Nature #WhatWouldNatureSay?",
