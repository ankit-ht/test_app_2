  "caption": "The weather is getting colder in #NYC. Today, over 350,000 NYC residents experience homelessness, while only 130,000 find space in insecure and overcrowded city shelters. 1 in 9 NYC students are homeless, and yet our city ONLY prioritizes migrant shelters. \n\nThat\u2019s why we need #NYS to open more mental health care hospitals, and house homeless families and children before we spend another cent on migrant shelter space. We need the promised health care workers helping #NYPD help emotionally disturbed persons out of our transit system. It is unsafe for all involved. With the city failing homeless every year, let\u2019s do our best this winter to help our most vulnerable!",
