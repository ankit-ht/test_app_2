  "caption": "Have you ever wondered where the powerful compounds in your favorite CBD products come from? \n\nWhile THC and CBD are famous, the cannabis plant is rich with over 80 active cannabinoids, each contributing to its unique therapeutic effects. These compounds are born in the trichomes, tiny structures on the plant. Here, resin glands produce and store cannabinoids and terpenes, essential for the plant's potency. Through careful harvesting and processing, we extract these trichomes to create high-quality cannabis extracts like CBD oil, rich in concentrated cannabinoids. The cannabis world is vast, with over 100 different cannabinoids, including CBN, CBG, and THCV, each with unique properties. The variety and concentration of these compounds vary across cannabis strains.\n\n#evohemp #poweredbyevohemp #cbd #cannabinoid",
