  "caption": "After a challenging childhood being raised by a single mom and getting kicked out by his stepdad at 13, @brentprimus155 turned to street fighting to get out his anger.\n\nThen \u201cone day I woke up and realized I\u2019m gonna end up in prison if I keep doing what I\u2019m doing.\u201d When a friend introduced him to jiu jitsu, \u201ceverything changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cJiu jitsu changed my mindset \u2014 there was so much respect and honor and discipline and hard work that went into it.\u201d\n\n20 years later, Brent has made a professional career out of it in the PFL. He prides himself on being the hardest worker in the room \u2014 and being the father he didn\u2019t have for his kids.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no greater motivation than wanting to be a good dad and a role model for them. I think it\u2019s super important that they see me working out, eating healthy, staying hydrated \u2014 they\u2019re gonna reflect it.\n\n\u201cI want to be the best version of myself for them.\u201d\n\nBrent has his first fight in the 2025 PFL tournament on Friday, April 18. Good luck, Brent \u2014 and Stay Salty \u26a1",
