Balance Me is another \u2018baby\u2019 and super demanding; in particular right now. The #worklife struggle/juggle is real and we don\u2019t always get the #balance quite right. But they never judge or complain; rather help keep us sane. And ensure we laugh and switch off as much as we can. \n\nA special shout out to Maia and Trixie because your model duties are often, and you don\u2019t charge us fees! Scroll to the end to see them in action!\n\nHappy Mother\u2019s Day! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udf38\n\n#mothersday #mothersanddaughters #motherhood #balanceme",
