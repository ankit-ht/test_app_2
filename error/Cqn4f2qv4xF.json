But if all you\u2019ve ever known is \u201cconditional love\u201d\u2026? \n.\n.\nWhere you\u2019re working yourself half to death and trying to find your worth in what you DO for God and people? \n.\n.\n.\nYou\u2019ll miss the real lesson. God loves you & wants you and Him to connect\u2026 and actually feel what it\u2019s like to BE ONE with God\n.\n.\nYes God has a purpose for your life. But you\u2019re a being BEFORE you have a purpose \n.\n.\n.\n#messageoftheday #messageforyiu #jesusislove #rebellion #holyspirit #godislove #name #namesofgod #heiswithyou #heisfaithful #controversial #ourprovider #emmanuel #godwithus #godsplan #godschild #biblestudy #yaweh #childoflight #saltoftheearth #womensempowerment #womensupportingwomen #womenofig #unityindiversity #womenspeakers #unityconsciousness #brandingidentity",
