  "caption": "Big Dan Burn is every Newcastle United fan. Word to Sampha, sometimes you have to let it all work out. From son of the soil, to blossoming at the home of football. Dreams really do come true. BDB saw the Wembley arch and rose to the occasion. The club\u2019s first goal at the home of English football for 25 years. The club\u2019s first trophy delivered for over 70 years. Had Mac Allister defending corner kicks like Rey Mysterio squaring up to the Great Khali. While this green giant had corn for Liverpool, don\u2019t forget how he had to get it out the mud. Went from being released by his boyhood club, to releasing them from the shackles of not seeing silverware. Navigated the choppy seas of non-league football only to steer the ship to the promised land of success. From local lad, to Local Hero. The boy from Blyth proved he\u2019s a Spartan. Not only did he do it for himself. He put on for the city. Don\u2019t get his antics mixed up with the joy of celebrating a goal. He had the spirit of 32,000 fans living vicariously through him. You can face setbacks. You can face adversity. But if you stay the course, the moment will arrive that makes it all worth it. Howay the lads.",
