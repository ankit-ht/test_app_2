The opening reception is Sunday 5/18 from 2-5PM, with an artist discussion at 3:30. Hope you\u2019ll stop by!\n\n\u201cMany of these pieces reflect my feelings about the confines of the Christian religion and meanings placed on religious iconography. The pieces with women in those spaces are a reaction against the role women are expected to have in the church.\u201c\n.\n.\n.\n#contemporarycollage #contemporarycollagemagazine #kolaj #kolajmagazine #cutandpaste #feminist #feministart #divinefeminine #femininepower #religiousart #spiritualart #womanartist #womeninart #artcollectors #womenartists #dada #surrealcollage #analogcollage #louisvilleartist #louisvillekentucky",
