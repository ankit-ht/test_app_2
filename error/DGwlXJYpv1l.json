N\u00f3s vamos sorrir! \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7\nWords can\u2019t express how thrilling and beautiful and surreal it was to be for the first time at the Oscar\u2019s the night BraSil won its first award. \nTo be surrounded by people that deeply inspire me and see my country, our culture, our stories and artists get the recognition they deserve fulfilled my heart with gratitude, love and hope.\nThank you @theacademy for having me and also a huge thank you to @donatella_versace and the entire @versace team for making me my dream dress. The most beautiful piece I\u2019ve ever worn. \nPARAB\u00c9NS, Walter, @oficialfernandatorres , @seltonmello e toda equipe e elenco. E MUITO obrigada.\nA VIDA PRESTA!",
