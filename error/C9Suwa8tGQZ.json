Here is the thing\u2014listening to your skin and giving it what it needs is really about being aware of your skin behaviors. \n \nTightness, excessive oiliness, dryness/flaking, congestion, irritation\u2014these are all behaviors that are signals sent by your skin in response to factors such as environment, the products you\u2019re using, or changes in your personal health.\n\nTo reset skin to its happiest, healthiest state, we recommend taking a #drunkbreak. \n\nDuring a #drunkbreak, we avoid the #suspicious6 (essential oils, drying alcohols, silicones, chemical sunscreens, fragrances/ dyes, and SLS). These are six categories of ingredients, which, research has shown, can be at the root of common skin issues, such as sensitivity and breakouts.",
