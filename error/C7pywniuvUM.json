In a review conducted at the Mayo Clinic of over 40 research studies, 11% (1 in 9) will develop IBS after food poisoning.\n\nThat means this year in America alone, 5 million people will develop post-infectious IBS! Patients with post-infectious IBS are four times more likely to contract food poisoning again. Additionally, if you do get food poisoning again, it can significantly worsen the symptoms of your post-infectious IBS. \n\nPost-infectious IBS presents itself as IBS-D or IBS-M. Therefore, you might have post-infectious IBS if:\n\ud83d\udca9 You have chronic diarrhea, traveler\u2019s diarrhea, or mixed diarrhea and constipation symptoms.\n\ud83d\ude2b You have abdominal pain and bloating.\n\ud83e\ude78 You have no other serious symptoms like blood in your stool.\n\ud83e\udd2e You have had food poisoning at some point in the past. (Note: Patients may not accurately recall whether they have had food poisoning.)\n\n\ud83d\udc9c Test yourself for post-infectious IBS with IBS-Smart, our at-home IBS test!
