Celebrity makeup artist @nicolewittman reveals how she prepped his skin with iS Clinical to bring this vision to life:\n\n\"This moment was about so much more than glam. It was about presence, strength, and graciousness. From the very start, I knew the skin had to lead the way. The goal wasn\u2019t to cover, but to enhance \u2014 letting Christian\u2019s natural radiance, confidence, and story shine through. Skincare was the star of this look. Every product was carefully chosen to nourish, calm, and elevate his skin, allowing it to speak for itself. Because today wasn\u2019t about seeing makeup \u2014 it was about seeing Christian. What a privilege to be part of a moment where beauty meets meaning.\n\nToday we made some Met-magic with my top skincare routine on the face of this year\u2019s Gala, Christian Latchman.\n\nI started by waking up the skin with a generous spritz of Copper Firming Mist \u2014 think of it as the skin\u2019s morning espresso, hydrating and plumping it back to life.\n\nNext, I tapped in the Youth Eye Complex around the eye area. This product smooths, soothes, and brings those under-eyes back to life like they just had 8 hours of sleep and a green juice.\n\nNext, came my calm and collected friend: the Hydra-Cool Serum \u2014 a cool-down moment for the skin. Especially perfect for the guys, it calms, hydrates, and leaves the face feeling like it just went on a spa retreat without leaving the makeup chair.\n\nAnd to finish, the glow MVP- Reparative Moisture Emulsion. This is my glow-getter, texture-smoother, makeup-melting BFF. It makes everything I layer on top glide like silk and leaves that flawless, camera-ready finish we all live for - especially for the first Monday in May.\"\n\n#iSCLINICAL \n#MetGala",
