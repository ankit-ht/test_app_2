Our faith in the light even amid unimaginable darkness. \ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f \n\nPrayer is language that doesn\u2019t include a demand, it simply offers its gratitude for it ALL. For life itself. \n\nPrayer and meditation is a way to open a conversation with existence, to say thank you, by noticing what is good, what is given to us, for all that stirs awe in our hearts. \n\nOn this #nationaldayofprayer, look around you in this moment, connect with the life within you, what miracle do you notice here now?",
