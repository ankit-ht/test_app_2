Into the light. I wanted to play with iridescence in hair, how this would pick up in strong lighting. I wanted to create a soft focal point on the hair without overwhelming the shot. I also just adore pink, it\u2019s my favourite colour so knew instantly it would 1, work well with iridescent panels and 2, make me happy. And I\u2019m so proud with how this image turned out. \n\nMy go to products were the colour dynamics range- they are so customisable. I loved playing with these to create the perfect balance of tone. I also could not have created such a strong styling without prepping the hair using mode volume mousse. \n\nI hope everyone enjoys the image as much as I do!' \ud83d\udcab\n\nSuch a dreamy result! \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf1f \n\n#asp #asphair #aspcolourrebels #hairstyle #haircolour #newhair #hairgoals #aspsalon #elixir #hairinspo",
