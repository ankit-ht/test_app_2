London my prince, I know your life has dealt with so many obstacles and health issues and this past year has been maybe the most challenging thus far, but you have shown so much resilience and strength. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd You are turning into a young man that I am so proud of. You are the one who turned me into a father first! I cannot believe you are already 5\u20195\u201d tall and wear a size 9 shoe! I don\u2019t want you to grow up and be like me, I want you to be better than me! Carry on the Yang Gang Legacy! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! #CBC \u267e\ufe0f \ud83d\udc99",
