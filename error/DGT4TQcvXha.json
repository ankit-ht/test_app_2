The crispy, savory bite of this snack was unreal \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\u2063\n\u2063\nI mixed shredded meat with @omsom Saucy Noodles, shredded potatoes, eggs, and cheese, then air-fried it at 425\u00b0F for 20 minutes.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe result was perfectly crispy bites, and dipping them in chili crisp mayo took them over the top \u2728\u2063\n\u2063\nI loved how the shaved meat weaved into the noodles, making each bite extra delicious. This technique unlocks so many possibilities. Maybe make fried rice with shaved canned meat next? \ud83d\udc40\u2063\n\u2063\nAlso\u2026 what do we call this?! Crispy noodle ball?! Help me name this snack \ud83e\udd2d\u2063\n\u2063\n#easyrecipes #snacks #noodles #chilicrisp #airfryerrecipes",
