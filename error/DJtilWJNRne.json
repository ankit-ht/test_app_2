  "caption": "A 2016 study in the British Journal of Psychology uncovered an unexpected link between intelligence and happiness: while frequent social interaction tends to boost life satisfaction for most people, the opposite holds true for those with higher intelligence.\n\nResearchers found that highly intelligent individuals often feel less satisfied when socializing too frequently. Instead, they tend to prefer solitude, deep focus, and meaningful, goal-oriented pursuits over casual interactions. This aligns with the \u201csavanna theory of happiness,\u201d which suggests our brains still respond to social settings shaped by evolutionary history\u2014and that smarter individuals are better equipped to navigate modern environments with fewer social dependencies.\n\nIn essence, it\u2019s not that intelligent people dislike connection\u2014it\u2019s that they seek quality over quantity. For them, peace, purpose, and depth matter more than constant company.\n\n#study #pubity #viral",
