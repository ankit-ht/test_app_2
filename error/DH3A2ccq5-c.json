Yet, they face unique challenges compared to their male counterparts, including limited access to land and resources. \n \n\ud83c\udf3e Meet Reina, one of many inspiring women farmers breaking barriers and cultivating change. As founding members of initiatives like @BetterLIfeFarming, we\u2019re supporting women, like Reina, to gain access to products, tools, solutions, and knowledge. \n\n\ud83e\udd1d Building an alliance of global and local partners is the start. We\u2019re empowering women to take the next step and play active roles in their communities. \n\n\ud83d\udc9a We love to hear stories of women smallholder farmers around the world on their journey to becoming agri-entrepreneurs!",
