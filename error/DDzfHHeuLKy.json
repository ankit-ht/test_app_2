Her brand, Maryam Nassir Zadeh (with the spelling of her last name tweaked), makes clothes that are simple, often skimpy, and meant to be piled on \u2014 fluttery cardigans shrugged over bikini tops, dresses over pants, leather jackets over slips, and wide belts cinched anywhere from upper ribs to hipbone. A typical MNZ outfit looks like it was fished out of a carry-on because you just got back from Ibiza and you\u2019re off to Hydra next week. \n\nNew York used to be a real shopping town. When MNZ opened, it joined independent boutiques all over downtown and gentrified Brooklyn where you could go find clothes you had never seen before. But below all this brick and mortar ran an algorithmic stream, and around 2017, it began to erode the foundations. In 2000, Net-a-Porter was founded. Then SSENSE. Then Farfetch. Department stores stepped up their e-commerce. And all of these websites did crazy, unbeatable sales. Smaller stores just could not compete. MNZ was more protected, at least for a while, but the seams were visible if you were looking for them.\u00a0By 2021,\u00a0Nassirzadeh admitted to\u00a0Vogue\u00a0that MNZ had been struggling to cover the cost of new samples for its clothes. Now, it\u2019s a mystery how the brand survives at all. But for the first time this year, MNZ did something many of her peers would have done long ago: collaborated with big brands like J.Crew. At the link in bio, features writer Madeline Leung Coleman delves into the rise and fall of Maryam Nassir Zadeh, and the brand\u2019s current efforts to rise yet again.\n\nPhoto: @marietomanova",
