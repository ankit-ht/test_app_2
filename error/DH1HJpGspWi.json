The event culminates in a 24-hour, no sitting, no sleeping dance marathon. Since 2006, more than $23 million has been raised to support pediatric cancer research and treatment. This weekend in Lexington, over 1,000 students are coming together to lead and participate in this extraordinary event.\n\nI could easily write a book about my passion for DanceBlue\u2014a passion that sparked my journey in design and has shaped my path as an entrepreneur. It\u2019s a privilege to return each year to contribute in new ways.\n\nEarlier this year, we introduced a special collaboration: our DanceBlue Reusable Rocks Glass Candle. This unique candle captures the spirit of this incredible cause and serves as a meaningful keepsake long after it\u2019s burned. \u2728\n\nTo learn more and support our philanthropic efforts, please visit the link in our bio. Every contribution counts! \ud83d\udc99",
