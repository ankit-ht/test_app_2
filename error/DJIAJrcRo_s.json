  "caption": "The difference between 93 and E85 on these things will never not impress me. \n\nThe only \u2018sort of\u2019 difference between these 2 runs is that we put ice in the tank for the last run on E85, which net\u2019d us about a 20 HP gain. \n\nSo even if we were to compare iced to iced, we\u2019re still talking over a 100 HP improvement from fuel quality alone. \n\nI blame GM\u2019s piston design. People have their opinions, but this one is mine. The reason why I think it\u2019s the pistons is because these cars run relatively fine on 93 with aftermarket pistons. I believe the sharp spots around the injector cups create hot spots which lead to detonation. \n\nI\u2019m making a point of posting this because I find it to be more industry knowledge, than common knowledge, still with this platform\u2026. And I honestly get tired of explaining why I suggest a 10k dollar fuel system anytime someone wants to upgrade their LT1/4\u2019s to this power level and beyond. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\n*And I\u2019m not talking about upgrading the DI injectors or HPFP\u2019s* which are ridiculously expensive and have a high failure/problem rate. \n\nIt\u2019s port injection for everything we do over here!\n\nDSX Atlas FTW \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc",
