Rally. I went to Beaumont to check it out.\n\nH.O.G. Rallies are centered around riding! The local chapters set pre-determined routes for you to go out and ride. Most of them are escorted rides, but you can go alone if you choose to. These rides are meant to show off the area, often going to or through cool places. I found myself on an Indian reservation and traveled to an old historic fort. Gas up before you go... the group will make stops, but make sure you\u2019re on full prior to leaving.\n\nYou will be gone pretty much the entire day on these rides. Most start leaving about 10 a.m., and they\u2019ll arrive back around 4\u20135 p.m.\n\nBring a camera... trust me.\n\nIt\u2019s truly a family atmosphere. You gotta understand that some of these riders have been in H.O.G. for over 30 years. It\u2019s easy to make friends, and next thing you know, you\u2019re talking about the next one while reminiscing about the previous ones.\n\nAll in all, I had an awesome time! We rode all over... ate... laughed... took pictures... did I mention we rode? \ud83e\udd23 Seriously, if you\u2019re looking for an opportunity to get out and ride with some great people... consider joining your local H.O.G. chapter. I promise you won\u2019t regret it. Peace \u270c\ufe0f\u201d\n\n#HarleyDavidson #HOG",
