Situations which require \u2018manners\u2019 or \u2018courtesy\u2019 in particular, for example manners around being served food that they don\u2019t like, or introducing yourself to new friends, or not staring when they seem someone who looks different from themselves. \n\nThis flipbook was recommended to me by a friend and it\u2019s now become our dinnertime conversation starter. I flip through it if there\u2019s anything in particular I\u2019m feeling we need to cover, and it provokes great discussions without being directed at any particular child, meaning we cover these topics from a joint place of curiosity rather than from a place of critique. \n\nIt gives a short, sharp, easy to understand explanations that make tricky topics easy to talk about and easy for kids to understand, and has been a really valuable tool to have in our home to help cover grace and courtesy with our young children!\n\n#everydayplayhacks #homeschool #playhacks #preschooltoys #montessoribaby #diymum #babyplayhacks #babysenory #homeschoolmum #sensoryplayideas #homeschoolmom #preschoolplay #preschoolplayideas #playathome #stayathomemum #playathomemummy #montessoriathome #preschoolactivities #preschoolactivitiesathome #toddlermum #montessoritoys #toyideas #playathomeactivities #creativekids #toyideasforkids #montessoripreschool #giftideasforkids #amazontoys #amazonfinds #cooltoys",
