Kids yelling. Parents laughing. I even heard stories of people learning in real time. A woman went to reach for one of my representatives hair but stopped midway as she looked at the arcade and read the title Hair Nah aloud as someone was playing. To the Smithsonian team, thank you so much for the kindness and the opportunity. \n\nHair Nah is currently ONLY showing at the Strong Museum of Play in New York.\n\nWhoop!\n\n#funny #familyfun #momopixel #hairnah #atsaam",
