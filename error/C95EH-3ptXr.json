I love that these shoes can double as a travel shoe as well as one I know I can trust hiking in the rainforest (or anywhere)! \n\nAbout 1.5miles into this hike, the clouds rolled in and graced the day with a downpour. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been testing out a HOKA shoe on a trail and rain made an appearance! But how often can you hike through the rainforest while it\u2019s actually raining? It was stunning, refreshing, and smelled amazing. I had no worries about comfort, traction or support because the Speedgoat 6 made sure every step was steady, supported and cushioned. I really put these shoes through their paces. \n\nI finished 5 miles of hiking, climbed over 1100ft of elevation in both rain and sun, and over varied terrain including wet roots, mud, rocks, dirt, thorny bushes, and leaves. I also found a beautiful flower that represented all the colors on my shoes. Nature IS the inspiration! The Speedgoat 6 really is the GOAT for trail runners and hikers!\n\nTo learn more about the Speedgoat 6, visit the @hoka website (link in bio)!\n\n#HOKAPartner\n#HOKAAdvocate\n#FlyHumanFly",
