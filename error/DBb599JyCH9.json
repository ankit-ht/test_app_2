With only 5 cities left to play before it\u2019s over, I knew I was going to be savoring every moment up on that stage but the bewildering passion of those crowds really blew my mind. It rained (a lot) the 1st and 3rd nights, and so that kicked up the cinematic drama. I had really missed this on our break. The mass quantities of joyful people genuinely living in the moment and seeming truly carefree for 3.5 hours. My mystifyingly talented friend @florence came to Miami and each night we performed \u201cFlorida!!!\u201d in Florida!!! I got some new outfits, and it\u2019s always nice when the crowd notices that \ud83d\ude01 You guys are just the best. Thank you to everyone who came and everyone who followed along online. 4 more cities left and the next one up is: New Orleans!\n\n\ud83d\udcf7: @johnshearer / @gettyimages / TAS Rights Management",
