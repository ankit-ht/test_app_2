  "caption": "Different US Cities and Their Respective Industry Focus\n \nCities in the US are so different in culture from each other that if you want to do business with US clients, you have to understand what they would prioritize\u2026\n \nFor example, New York does not care about startups, what it cares about is finance, media and fashion. If you\u2019re in NY, the way to win is to understand global financial markets and be extremely fashionable to fit in\u2026 (It has seen 85% growth in fintech investments over the past 3 years)\n \nBoston, on the other hand, is quite the opposite. It\u2019s all about building businesses that are built on long term vision, patient capital, and years of research like in Biotechnology and in AI. To win here, you have to belong to a top educational institute\u2026 (They\u2019ve had over USD 8 Bn invested in Biotech just last year)\n \nWhile San Francisco would be known as the Startup Capital, Austin is now the fastest growing tech hub with companies like Tesla and Oracle moving here, and new tech founders are willing to come here instead. They all prioritize growth over profitability.\n \nBy comparison, Chicago startups reach profitability much faster and are more profit conscious.\n \nLA\u2019s focus is on media tech and gaming, clearly with its links to Hollywood. If you\u2019re building something in the creator economy, this is where you come.\n \nAnd if you wish to build in Crypto or focus on the Latin American market, you come down and build in Miami.\n \nAs for Seattle, go there is you work in Microsoft or Amazon. There is absolutely no other reason to be there.\n \n#casarthakahuja",
