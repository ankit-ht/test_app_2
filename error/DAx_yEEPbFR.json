Alongside Ankit Gupta, Manan Khurma, and Mike Tarrant, Pranjal highlighted the importance of 'Glocalization' in scaling education globally.\n\nAs education continues to expand beyond borders, the balance between global strategies and local insights is more important than ever. Glocalization allows educational models to adapt and thrive in diverse regions, addressing unique needs while maintaining a global perspective. By working closely with local leaders and partnering with trusted education organizations, we can create impactful, scalable solutions that resonate with diverse learners and educators across the world. \n\nThe 3rd Annual #ASUGSVEmeritusSummit will convene over 650 thought leaders across education, technology, workforce, investors, government, and more to explore groundbreaking ideas and solutions shaping the #FutureOfEducation.\n\nJoin us in Gurgaon, February 3-5, 2025, for an inspiring dialogue that will drive education innovation forward.
