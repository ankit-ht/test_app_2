The evening was hosted in collaboration with the Munch Museum and Hauser & Wirth, and concluded with dinner at the Portrait Restaurant, overlooking Trafalgar Square. \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThank you to everyone who joined us and made it so special.\n\n@munchmuseum @nationalportraitgallery @hauserwirth @allison.katz @loubuck01 #MUNCHxREJINAPYO",
