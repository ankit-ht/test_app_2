  "caption": "Two decades ago, Tina Craig and a friend started the pioneering blog Bag Snob, followed by a beauty-focused spin-off. Her interests were aligned, Craig says: \u201cBeauty and bags at department stores are always on the same floor. They don\u2019t require sizing!\u201d Her Chinese upbringing underscored the importance of good skin care, so it was fitting when Craig and her partners launched U Beauty in 2019. The brand\u2019s patent-pending SIREN capsule technology enables next-level ingredient delivery, but her dreamed-up formulas are just as ingenious. When a new product is in development, she says, \u201cI want my whole team obsessed.\u201d Here, Craig brings exactly that enthusiasm to her well-edited BAG at violetgrey.com.",
