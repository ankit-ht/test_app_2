She was diagnosed at 3 with alopecia Areata and since then we have tried several wigs, toppers, real hair, synthetic hair and this one by far is the best! It\u2019s light weight and the color and cut is amazing. We purchased it through the children with hair loss program.\" \u2060-Breanne W.\u2060\n\u2060\nP.S. Huge shoutout to Children With Hair Loss @cwhl_org\u2060 for the incredible work they do supporting children experiencing hair loss \u2014 we\u2019re proud to stand with you! \ud83e\udef6\u2060\n\u2060\nDetails:\u2935\ufe0f\u2060\n\ud83d\udda4 Wig: Ashley\u2060\n\ud83d\udda4 Color: Luscious Caramel\u2060\n\u2060\n #JonRenau #JonRenauWigs #Wigs #Alopecia #HairLoss #HairThinning #ThinHair #KidsWigs ##WigsforKids #CWHL",
