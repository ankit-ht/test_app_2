From workwear to Catholic rosaries, exaggerated collars to the streets of Fresno, his runways aren\u2019t just fashion\u2014they\u2019re statements, protests, love letters to a world that has tried to erase people like him. His latest collection, Tarantula, debuted just as the U.S. doubled down on stripping identities and histories. Chavarria resists, reclaims, and reimagines. Shot beside one of his muses, Paloma Elsesser, this cover story celebrates Willy and his community, sending the message that \u201cHow we love is who we are.\u201d\n\nText @linalovesit\n\nPhotographer @ilyesgriyeb\nStylist @elliegracecumming\nCreative Producer @fatimamouradd\nProducer sainteangele @kitten_production \nCasting @11casting\nSet Design @tibzmunoz \nHair @stephanie_farouze\nMake-up @nisha_gulati\nModels Paloma Elsesser @palomija Lineisy Montero @lineisymontero Tif\u00e9 Adeyemi @tifeadeyemi_\nWilly Boys Jonathan Gonzalez @itsjonathang Erik Martinez @chachimaserati Christiano Wennmann @christiano.kei\nChino Salazar @chinochingaso Chris Colvin @st.chriiis Shaid Anaya @shaid_anaya\n\nEditor-in-Chief @ahmadaswaid\nFashion Director @omaimasss\nDeputy Editor @sarraalayyan\nCreative Director @chndy_\nArt Director @da.o.ud\nContent Director @fadynageeb\nCreative Producer @fatimamouradd\n\n#DazedMENA #Issue01 #NewArchetypes",
