Starring the iconic Mercedes R107 in its natural habitat of Beverly Hills. Built in Germany, driven in CA 90046 and all over the Hollywood hills these legendary coupes were an instant hit on the sunny side of the Atlantic! Iconized on the big screen in movies like American Gigolo starring Richard Gere and with regular appearances on TV shows such as Dallas and Hart to Hart this was the ultimate car of the 80\u2019s and still today turns heads on Sunset Blvd! I bought one five days after first stepping foot in LA and continue to love and collect these motoring gems.\nThis piece is produced in three sizes.
