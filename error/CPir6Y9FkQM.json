I have felt his energy jolt my system many times since his physical self left this universe and still often think about the 47 lifetimes we lived together from Tokyo to Paris to Laguna Beach. Those memories will stay with me forever. To say he was ahead of his time would be a big minimization. Whenever I was with Jonas, I felt stronger and unfuckwitable, he brought me ultimate confidence, strength and courage. There isn\u2019t a single Asian in fashion today who could hold a candle to Jonas and what he meant to Asians all over the world(from industry insiders to those outside looking in.) He gave a lot of dudes in streetwear their birth in the business and nobody has a bad story about him. I just wish he could be here today so that my kids could have met him. We pushed each other to the maximum in everything and in 2006 we started using the term \u201cto the moon\u201d that\u2019s no bullshit. Jonas, I miss you so much bro. Until the next life fam. You will always be loved by me. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc94 of course today\u2019s episode of BTB is dedicated in honor of him. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n#LRG #47tilinfinity #AdoptChildrenNotStyles #JonasBevacqua #Catdicc1",
