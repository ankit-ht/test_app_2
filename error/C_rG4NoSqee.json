  "caption": "What is Babyfacial and why do I need it?\n\nBabyfacial is our pro-quality 25% AHA/2% BHA mask that exfoliates and resurfaces skin, revealing greater clarity, improved texture and tone, and a more youthful-looking radiance. \n\nOnce a week, apply an even layer of Babyfacial to clean, dry skin. Leave on for up to 20 minutes. Rinse thoroughly with lukewarm water and pat dry. Follow up with a gentle moisturizer, like Virgin Marula Oil.\n\n#babyfacialsunday via @wcpunk4",
