This isn\u2019t just another assignment\u2014it\u2019s a full-circle moment.\n\nWhen I was studying architecture, Alessi represented the epitome of contemporary elegance and innovation. It was the chic icon of design, merging function and artistry in a way that deeply inspired me. Back then, I dreamed of collaborating with such a visionary brand\u2014one that helped shape my creative eye long before I ever picked up a camera professionally.\n\nTo now bring my visual world to Alessi\u2019s design universe feels surreal and deeply meaningful. It\u2019s more than a shoot\u2014it\u2019s a creative homecoming.  Special thanks to the Creative director and great Friend @andreaincontri to give me the opportunity to bring back to life these iconic masterpieces \u2764\ufe0f #design \u2014#architecture #studiosgura casting @simobartcasting styling @sofiabrini__ assisted by @ulianasgura",
