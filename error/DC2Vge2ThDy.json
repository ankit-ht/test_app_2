I carried a weight in my chest, a numbness I couldn\u2019t quite describe, and an overwhelm of uncertainty \u2013 I knew, for the sake of my overall health, that I needed movement back in my life.\u00a0\n\nI wanted a goal that was big, uncomfortable, and meaningful. A challenge to hold me accountable and reconnect me with running and myself. The NYC Marathon became that goal, @brasforgirlsorg became the \u201cwhy\u201d, and running once again became my safe place to land.\n\nThank you, @hoka, for giving me the platform to share my story and for the support every step (literally!) of the way. \ud83d\udc99 Link in bio to read the full blog!",
