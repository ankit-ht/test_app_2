It's made with fresh bananas, creamy peanut butter, rich coconut cream, and refreshing oat milk.\n\nRun, don't walk, to get your paws on the treat of the summer because, just like our favorite season, it's here for a good time, not a long time. Grab your pup a 14oz pint through your Ollie membership, at a local Petco, or at most Van Leeuwen scoop shops while supplies last.",
