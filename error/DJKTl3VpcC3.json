For many of us, it was the first time reading it.\n\nThe poem was written as part of The Power to Tell Stories, an event where people came together to share their experiences of starting over in a new place. We knew we had to share it here too! Have you read it before, or were you part of the group who created it?\n\nYou can read the full poem in the next two slides. \u2192",
