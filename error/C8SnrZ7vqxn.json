Thank you for making the best dinner every night, for all the Publix runs (and cookies obviously), for all the snuggles and reading Hello America every night, for being up for all the adventures, for being the household procurement department, for making us a hockey family, and for the endless love and hugs and kisses.\n\nWe love you! \ud83e\udd0d",
