I was in the cab of the snowcat, and my nephew Alex was on the ground attaching the Ford truck to the back of the snowcat with chains. We started pulling the truck out of the snow and got it unstuck. Alex went to unlatch it from the snowcat as I started to turn the snowcat around. But its snowblade was up high and I couldn\u2019t quite see Alex, who was somewhere in front of me. I got out of the driver\u2019s seat and stepped on the tracks to talk to him.\u2060\n\u2060\n\u201cBefore exiting the driver\u2019s cab! \u2014 Apply parking brake,\u201d the manual says. But I didn\u2019t engage the parking brake, or disengage the steel tracks. In that moment \u2014 an innocent, critical, life-changing moment \u2014 that tiny but monumental slip of the mind would change the course of my life for ever\" | \u270d\ufe0f Jeremy Renner\u2060\n\u2060\nClick the link in bio to read his full account\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udcf8  GUERIN BLASK FOR THE SUNDAY TIMES MAGAZINE\u2060\nMAKE-UP: TRACY EWELL\u2060\nHAIR: KIMI MESSINA",
