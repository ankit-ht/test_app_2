In fact, some of our best memories are centered around the grill! Aside from the satisfaction of building a crackling fire and gathering with loved ones around it, a fired-up grill is essential for flavoring and cooking your backyard asada meal. We love that cooking over a fire adds smoke and char to veggies and fajitas. \u00a1Buen Provecho!\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\n\n#sietefoods #backyardasadaseason #backyardasada #grilling #grilltips #grillingseason",
