My inspiration for this collection was a throwback to the glory days of alpine sports when men wore blazers and ties proudly as they navigated steep glaciers and traversed crevases on some of the most hostile and challenging terrain. Images of handsome bronzed European men in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s blazing down the slopes of St Moritz dressed like they were on the way to a formal dinner has always inspired me. Those who know me well are aware of my love for luxury fabrics and my penchant for the finest of tailoring. This next step in my career has been a wonderful experience and to have had the opportunity to design with the masters of Italian style @kiton has been a dream come true. Travelling to Naples last summer to select the fabrics and work on designs with the Paone family was an experience I will never forget. To see the teams of artisans hand stitching each garment step by step is simply breathtaking. Bravo @kiton . My mission is to bring timeless elegance back to the slopes and we are only starting. Thanks to you @mariagiovannapaone , @antoksasha , @twins_piu_one and @daniele.q \n\n#kiton #alpine #winterfashion #tonykellyworld #ski",
