But given Johnson\u2019s razor-thin margin \u2013 plus conservatives in his conference who tend to oppose short-term funding fixes\u2013 House Dems will likely be the ones to get it over the finish line.\n\nTypically, punting a funding deadline into a new year when Republicans will control every lever of power would make Dems shudder. This time, they\u2019re not putting up much of a fight, but they have made one main demand clear for the stopgap: a robust supplemental package for disaster aid. More on how those negotiations could unfold at the link in bio. \n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Francis Chung/POLITICO\n\npoliti.co/3OKZDID",
