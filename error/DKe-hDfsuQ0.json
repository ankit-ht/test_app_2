Feels like you were just learning to crawl and now you\u2019re running the whole house (and my heart) like it\u2019s your job. You\u2019re sweet, wild, hilarious, and already cooler than I\u2019ll ever be.\n\nThank you for making life louder, messier, and a million times more fun. I\u2019m the luckiest to be your Dad and watch you grow into the little superstar you are. Keep shining, kiddo. \ud83c\udf08\ud83e\udd84\n\nHere\u2019s to all the giggles, dance parties, and snack attacks coming your way this year. Love you forever, even when you steal all my snacks. \ud83d\udc9c\n\n#HappyBirthday #LilyTurns4 #GirlDad #ProudParent #GrowingUpTooFast",
