I like to tell them, \u201cI know you want mommy to do bedtime, but tonight, [your partner] is going to do it!\u201d\n\nAs I mentioned in the video, you could also have your child choose specific days of the week where your partner is in charge of bedtime, and you could also have your partner gradually get themselves involved in the bedtime process by taking over one task at a time. However, even with that, it\u2019s normal for there to be a period of adjustment once your partner takes over. \n\nOf course you guys should have a game plan in advance (any non negotiable like, if you have been making progress with not lying in bed with your child until they fall asleep, that should be the one boundary that your partner holds), but during the process, let your partner figure out ways to regulate your child on their own, without your involvement. And for those of you who are stressed out about the timing of bedtime and just want to rush things along, go into this expecting that it\u2019s going to take longer than usual to begin with.\n\nConsistency is key here, so know that it might be hard before it gets \u201cnormal\u201d (I would say \u201ceasy,\u201d let\u2019s be real, you\u2019re still putting a kid to bed at the end of a long day\u2026nothing is easy anymore).\n\nIf you aren\u2019t even in this realm and you are experiencing bigger issues like your child waking up constantly in the night, you being unable to leave their room, you wanting to transition them into their own sleep space, I have my Tackling Toddler Sleep Course at TacklingToddlerSleep.com!\n\n#extinctionburst #motherhood #sleep #sleeping #parenting #married #marriedlife #partners #love #marriage #marriedwithchildren #routine",
