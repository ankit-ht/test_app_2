I am proud to announce that I am the newest member of the @sako7squad and a SaKO7 ambassador. My question to you is do you have what it takes to be a SaKO7 ambassador??? They are looking for credible creators, ambassadors and influencers to fly the SaKO7 flag! If you think you have what it takes. Send @sako7official a DM and your various social media pages.\n\n#SaKO7 \u2022 #SaKO7socks \u2022 #SaKO7kit \u2022 #sockdoping \u2022 #kitdoping \u2022 #ilovecycling \u2022 #allblack \u2022 #black \u2022 #blackkit \u2022 #cyclinglegend",
