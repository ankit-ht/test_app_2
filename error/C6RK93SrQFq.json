A will GUARANTEES that you will go through probate \u2014 all of which becomes public record and can involve a lot more taxes.\n\nThere were judges at the conference from Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties.\n\nIn Broward, the probate division is seeing a 40% increase in filings year-over-year while there hasn\u2019t been a budget for a new probate judge since 2000-2002.\n\nThe judges GENUINELY care about doing a great job and want this process to be better but they are COMPLETELY overloaded.\n\nThat\u2019s just another reason to avoid ever having to go through probate.\n\nThe conversations at the conference heavily focused around the transfer of property because SO MANY probates (last stats I\u2019ve seen say 70%) probates involve property.\n\nLegacies aren\u2019t built when everything is good \u2014 it\u2019s built in how the lows are prepared for.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how to protect your legacy, we interview experts and attorneys like @lawyerlaurenklein on our Legacy Show to help you handle these exact situations.\n\nComment VIDEO to check out our recent episodes.",
