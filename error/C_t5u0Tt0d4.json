  "caption": "Got chronic diarrhea? It could be Intestinal Sulfide Overproduction (ISO). High levels of hydrogen sulfide in your small bowel can lead to chronic, severe diarrhea. To find out if you have ISO, you must use a breath test...\nBUT conventional breath tests only measure 2 gases: Hydrogen (SIBO) and Methane (IMO)\n\nTrio-Smart tests for all 3 gases: Hydrogen, Methane, and Hydrogen Sulfide. This gives you a complete picture of your gut health. If you test positive for ISO, your provider can help you manage your symptoms with a personalized treatment plan.\n\nWant to learn more?
