The facial massage spheres are designed to be used after applying the Pro-Recovery serum. \n\nGently roll the pair of spheres over the lymph nodes on the face and neck to help reduce inflammation and support skin health. This process facilitates the natural elimination of excess fluids and toxins while enhancing the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to support efficient lymphatic function and achieve optimal skin health. \n\nShare your #SwisslineRitual with us. \u2728",
