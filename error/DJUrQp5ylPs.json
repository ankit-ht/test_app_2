Their goofiness and silly personalities brighten every single day and no matter what I accomplish in the pool, they just know me as \u201cdad\u201d. \n \nTogether with @NuloPetFood, I invite you to take a moment today to thank your pet for all the comfort and support they give you by posting an incredible moment you\u2019ve shared with them (or a silly picture of your pet)! Use the hashtag #TheyFuelUs and tag @nulopetfood for a chance to be featured on Nulo\u2019s social media. \n \n#FuelIncredible #NuloPartner",
