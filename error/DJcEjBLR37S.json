Like many moms, I experienced major hair thinning in the months after having my baby. It was hard to accept, and it definitely affected my confidence.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m starting my journey with Kerotin \u2014 a brand made to help with postpartum hair loss and support healthy hair growth. I\u2019ve seen real results from other women, and I\u2019m so hopeful this will be a turning point for me too.\n\nIf you\u2019re a mama going through something similar \u2014 I see you. You\u2019re not alone. And it\u2019s okay to take care of yourself too.\n\nFollow along \u2014 I\u2019ll be sharing updates as I go!\n\n#Kerotin #PostpartumHairLoss #HairRecovery #MomLife #HairJourney #KerotinPartner",
