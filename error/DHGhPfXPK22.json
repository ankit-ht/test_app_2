Alarmingly, going without sleep for 20 hours affects driving ability, similar to having a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08%, which is above the legal limit in the U.S.\n\nConsidering that drowsiness contributes to roughly 1 in every 5 fatal car accidents, we urge you to take action this World Sleep Day.\n\nFor any concerns about drowsy driving, contact Jacoby & Meyers at 800-500-0000 or visit our website for a free consultation.\n\n#drowsydriving #personalinjuryattorney #personalinjurylaw #injurylaw #injurylawyers #injurylawyer #injuryattorney #accidentlawyer #caraccidentlawyer #JacobyAndMeyers",
