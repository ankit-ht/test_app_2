  "caption": "Back in December, 11 year-old Ajax academy baller Zinedine Chaiat went viral for doing 2424 kickups before Ajax\u2019s game in front of the entire stadium. \ud83d\udca5\n\nHe didn\u2019t drop the ball once! He even had players around him applauding him too. Zinedine Chaiat ended up delaying kick off because he didn\u2019t drop the ball. \ud83d\ude02\u26bd\ufe0f\n\nIn February, before Ajax\u2019s game, Zinedine came back and broke his own record by doing over 2600 kickups. He had to be stopped because the game was about to begin. Incredible composure for an 11 year-old. \ud83e\udd2f",
