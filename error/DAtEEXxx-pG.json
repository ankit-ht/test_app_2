After taking Joanne Chang\u2019s baking class on MasterClass, I finally mastered the art of P\u00e2te Bris\u00e9e. Inspired by their blackberry tea flavor, I decided to put my own spin on the recipe and created a blackberry pie while following Joanne\u2019s step-by-step technique.\n\nI\u2019ve shared some key tips below to help you get started this pie season. If you\u2019re ready to elevate your baking game or try something new, pick up any flavor of Pure Leaf Real Brewed Iced Tea and see what you can create! I got a free month of MasterClass through a promotion from @pureleaf Real Brewed Iced Tea after purchasing a six-pack (details in my bio).\n \nBaking Tips:\n-When incorporating butter into flour, Cut butter into 1-inch chunks and make sure it is cold\n-The butter should lightly coat the flour, but you still want visible pecan-sized chunks of butter. The dough should start to hold its shape when squeezed together.\n-The secret to a flaky crust is the fraisage technique: smear the dough by hand to ensure the butter is perfectly incorporated.\n-Cold eggs are much easier to separate.\n-Be patient! Chill the dough thoroughly. It needs to be firm before baking so that steam releases from the water, creating that signature flakiness.",
