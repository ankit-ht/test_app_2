You\u2019re restless. \n\nYou\u2019re not imagining it.\nThere\u2019s something deeper going on.\n\nHave you looked at your ferritin levels?\nBecause we\u2019ve seen this with so many clients, the problem isn\u2019t always in the obvious markers.\nIt\u2019s in the reserves.\n\nFerritin is your iron bank.\nHemoglobin can look perfect while ferritin is quietly running on empty.\nThis is what we call iron deficiency without anemia (IDWA), which is an early red flag.\n\nThis is why a holistic approach matters.\nBecause health isn\u2019t just about fixing the obvious.\nIt\u2019s about understanding the systems underneath the symptoms.\n\nMedicine is powerful, and always take what your doctor prescribes.\nBut pair it with a lifestyle plan:\n\u2192 Check your nutrition\n\u2192 Understand absorption\n\u2192 Address gut health\n\u2192 Work on rest and recovery\n\u2192 And always recheck.\n\nSometimes the answer is that simple.\nAnd sometimes it takes zooming out, not digging deeper.\n\nThat\u2019s the beauty of integrative and lifestyle medicine \u2014 it doesn\u2019t replace, it complements.\n\n#LowFerritin #IronDeficiency #IntegrativeMedicine #LifestyleMedicine #RootCauseHealing #HolisticHealth #FatigueFix",
