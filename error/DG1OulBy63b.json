The birria grilled cheese was an unexpected standout, and the peach French toast? Simply divine!\n\nThe drinks were on another level - don\u2019t miss their matcha macadamia lavender latte (absolute heaven!), rich Gotham mocha, and refreshing Freddo cappuccino.\n\nPerfect spot for breakfast or lunch with options for every taste. The atmosphere matches the quality of the food - cozy yet stylish.\n\nHave you been to @forfive yet? What\u2019s your go-to order?\n\n#AtlantaEats #ForFiveCoffee #FoodieFind #PeachtreeEats #BrunchGoals #ATLCoffeeShop\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",
