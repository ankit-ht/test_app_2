No shame. Just real talk with real experts - and real answers you can actually use.\n\nOn May 13th, we\u2019re going virtual to bring you conversations that calm your nervous system, clear your mind, and boost your confidence for the road ahead.\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019ve been carrying around questions (or guilt, or fear) about your finances post-divorce, this space is for you.\n\n\u2192 If you\u2019re craving honest, supportive guidance instead of \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d advice, this space is for you.\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019re ready to feel strong, capable, and excited about what\u2019s next \u2014 this space is for you.\n\nBring your coffee. Bring your notebook. Bring your messy, beautiful self.\n\nLINK BIO \ud83d\udc95\n\n#estateplanning #divorce #unscripted",
