Every month we support the \u2018I AM A GIRL\u2019  foundation, by giving 5% of all our online purchases to this worthy cause that promotes education, equal rights and child rights. \u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9f\n.\n\nFind out more on our website bombaybrowbar.com.\n.\n.\n.\n#InternationalYouthDay2020 #IYD #Youth #BeTheChange #GirlPower #bombaybrowbar #globalaction #iamagirl",
