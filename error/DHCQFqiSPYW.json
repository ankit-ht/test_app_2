She is based out of Buenos Aires, but always roaming.\n\nShe welcomes new clients to YouLi, by showing them how to use our tools most effectively & keeps internal operations running smoothly.\n\nFollowing a history of involvement in social justice movements & nonprofit work, she now enjoys working in a field that is such a big part of her life -- TRAVEL! She sees travel as both a thrilling & important opportunity for us to learn more about each other and the world around us.\n\nClaire has visited over 25 countries and has a big heart for volunteering, cooking, ceramics, aimless walks, yoga, dancing, and meeting new people. \n\nAs you may have seen in a previous post, Claire is currently on maternity leave, but we look forward to welcoming her back this summer!\n\n#womenintech #traveltech #iwd",
