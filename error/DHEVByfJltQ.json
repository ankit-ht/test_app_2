  "caption": "Roughly 200,000 miles of Duke Energy above-ground power lines wind through a six-state footprint that includes the highlands of Kentucky, the mountains of western North Carolina, and the towering willow oaks of Charlotte. In each of these areas, trees and vegetation can pose hazards to power lines and thus, reliability.\n\nBecause of the varied terrain Duke Energy covers, the company employs two vegetation teams and a variety of pruning tools and methods to clear trees and vegetation that may interfere with the lines.\n\n\u201cThe objective is to maintain the lines \u2013 before the trees and brush are close enough to cause outages \u2013 in a manner that is consistent with good arboricultural practices,\u201d said Wesley Frick, manager of distribution vegetation at Duke Energy.\n\nClick the link in our bio for more about the team responsible for vegetation management.",
