He says, \u201cPadSplit is the future of rentals. My gross is well over double.\u201d\n\nPeter\u2019s monthly net income jumped from $2,500 to $4,600.\n\n\u201cWith PadSplit, I like that it\u2019s not all or nothing whether it is rented or not. If one bedroom isn\u2019t booked, you still make money on the others. I converted the first side of my duplex, and within 24 hours, all my rooms were booked,\u201d says Peter.\n\n#realestateinvestorleads #realestateinvestormentor #realestateinvestorsdallas #realestateinvestorshouston #realestateinvestorsinflorida #realestateinvestorlist #realestateinvestormarketing #realestateinvestorsinmyarea #realestateinvestorsintexas #padsplitvsairbnb",
