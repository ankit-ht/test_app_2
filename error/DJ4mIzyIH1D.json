  "caption": "MY BIRTH STORY: It all started about 1 week prior to Rio being born with me having small contractions every now and then during a few nights. It felt like a small period cramp but nothing that bothered me too much. They came very unregular and could vanish for a night or so before coming back. \n\nOn Friday evening ( 21st of February) I went to my friend Magdas place and had a movie night, when I felt a change in the contractions, but still not to the point that I felt that something was happening. That night I woke up with more contractions but not in a way that I felt was to take action on. I took a hot shower and went back to sleep. \n\nOn the 22 of February I woke up with contractions being gone again and went on with my day. Later that evening I had scheduled to swing by my other apartment since I had sold it and was supposed to give them the keys on Monday. Right before Jesper came home from work I started feeling contractions again and now a bit more frequent. We made dinner and ate it in front of the TV when I started to feel the contractions get closer to each other. But in my mind I was like \u201dnah, this is not it. They are so manageable and it\u2019s my body playing tricks on me. And yeah, I still need to swing by my apartment to get the last bags of clothes from the attic\u201d. Said and done - I jumped into a cab and went to get the bags, carrying big bags of clothes up and down the attic ( yes, I\u2019m a very stubborn person). Once back home again I started to feel even more contractions and closer and closer to eachother,  but not too painful and I didn\u2019t want to go in to the hopsital only to be sent back home if I wasn\u2019t open enough. \n\nContinuning my story in the comments\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\n#birth #pregnancy #birthstory",
