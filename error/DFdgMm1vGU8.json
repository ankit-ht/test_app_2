TSH is a hormone produced in the brain that tells the thyroid gland to make more T3 and T4 thyroid hormones in response to environmental factors. It is important to know your TSH levels, however, TSH isn\u2019t enough to determine the status of your overall thyroid health.\n\nFunctional medicine providers, like Parsley Health, offer a more comprehensive panel of tests to get to the root cause of thyroid issues. By covering a wider breadth of hormones, clinicians are able to spot unusual ranges\u2014and note any changes.\n\nLab tests are one of the most important tools in your prevention kit. Essential tests also reveal inflammatory markers and deficiencies in key nutrients like Vitamin D.\n\nHead to our link in bio to learn even more about thyroid health.",
