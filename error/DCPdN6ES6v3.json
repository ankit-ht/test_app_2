As a country, we should demand our local officials always prioritize veteran healthcare access and affordability, including mental health care. No homeless veteran should be left on the street, or feel they can\u2019t afford to keep themselves or their families afloat. \n\nWe must always help our veterans first. Let\u2019s do our part to make sure no veteran is left behind after putting their lives on the line for all of us.",
