Having a good gel to mold your hair is major \ud83d\udd11.\n\n2. EDGES & BABY HAIR | Swoops and woops around your hair line will add some sass to just about any hairstyle- whether it's a #puff, #washngo, or slick back ponytail. We have our #lemongrassslayandlayedgegel but a good gel like our #lemongrassholditstylinggel is a great option too!\n\n3. PROTECTIVE STYLES & LOC RETWISTS | If you notice the foundation to a good protective style is how you prep and lay the hair closest to your scalp. Using a thicker product like gel, edge control, or pomade is so helpful and ensures your style lasts longer! It's great for your flyaways too!\n\n4. WASH N' GO | Using a hair gel for wash n' gos almost makes the style live up to it's name- literally wash and go! It will make your curls pop and last longer!\n\n5. ROD SETS | Using a mousse is more ideal however add a bit of gel to the ends to make sure the curls that shape your #afro are a bit MORE defined and crisp!\n\n6. FINGERWAVES | Where are our #TWA girls at? You have to try #fingerwaves at least a few times before your hair grows out! If you can't achieve this style with mousse GEL is your friend!\n\n7. WIG INSTALL | If you're not a fan of glue and sprays our Hold It Styling Gel is a great option to melt down your lace with lasting hold! Try it and share your experience with us!\n\nWe hope this list helps you get maximum use out of your gel products! Our #HoldItStylingGel is one of the best gels on the market because the HOLD is extreme and super long-lasting! Don't worry- it is extremely nourishing too as it is enriched with high quality ingredients like #jojobaoil and #lemongrassoil to help strengthen your hair while it holds it into place.\n\n\ud83c\udff7 SAVE THIS POST FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.\n\nShop at alikaynaturals.com or check your local @Walmart, @Target, @HEB, or @CVSPharmacy to grab yours \ud83c\udf3a",
