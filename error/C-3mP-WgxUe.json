That\u2019s the key! Smooth and tame as you go, because spraying it with finishing hairspray will never do the trick! \ud83d\ude45\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI loved sharing product knowledge with my students and seeing them have those \u201clight bulb\u201d moments! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udca1 \n\nP.S. if you don\u2019t have Aquage Spray Wax in your kit\u2026 WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! It\u2019s literally magic frizz control in a can! \ud83e\udd29\n\n\u2757\ufe0fIf you\u2019re interested in attending my next class, it\u2019s on September 9th in Woodstock, Georgia! DM me for a discount code, and grab your seat before they sell out! I\u2019d love to see you there! \ud83d\ude0d \n\nSalon host:\n@landcosalon \nMannequin:\n@pivotpointintl custom colored \u201cIngrid\u201d (use code hannaheasterwood10 to save $$)\nClass sponsors:\n@designmehair \n@aquagehaircare \nMagnetic bracelet:\n@pinkpewter \n\n#haireducation #haireducator #hairclass #saloneducation #saloneducator #bridalhaireducation #updoeducator #updoeducation #designme #designmehair #aquage #aquagehaircare #pivotpoint #pinkpewter #roswellga #alpharettaga #woodstockga #atlantahairstylist #atlantahairstylists #hairreels #hairreel #hairstylistreels #hairstylistlife #bridalhairstylist #weddinghairstylist #updohairstyles #updostyles #updotutorial #hairtutorials #hairtutorial",
