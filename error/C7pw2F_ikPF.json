  "caption": "A female security guard at the Cannes Film Festival has gone viral for her treatment of celebrities on the red carpet. She was first filmed being told off by Kelly Rowland after trying to hurry her up the stairs, and since then, several of her interactions with other celebrities have surfaced. Some viewers have accused the security guard of only treating celebrities of colour in this way, while others have defended her, saying she\u2019s just doing her job.\n\nIs the security guard doing too much? \ud83d\udc6e \nCredit : @screenshothq \n\n \n\n#reel #reels #reelsinstagram #walk #explore #cannes #cannesfilmfestival #explorepage #exploremore #explorepage\u2728 #reelsvideo #viralreels #reelsinstagram #reelsinsta #reelsviral #reelsvideo #reelslovers #trendingreels #trendingreel #celeb #celebrity #celebritystyle",
