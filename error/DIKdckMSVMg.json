Four. \n\nTen states have less available houses...\n\nThirty six states have WAYYY LESS available houses. \n\nAlaska has less than half the available number of homes for sale as we did in 2019, Maryland is slightly better at -48% less... The whole Northeast is not any better. \n\nSooooooooo... you want to keep waiting for a change or are you willing to take control of your situation and do the ONE thing that can benefit your future almost more than any other wealth building action can??\n\n\ud83c\udfe1If you\u2019re looking to buy or sell a home anywhere in the county I can help either directly or but introducing a trusted referral partner, no matter the price point. \ud83c\udfe1\n\nRandy the Realtor\nReliable\nResourceful\nResilient\n\n\ud83d\udce7: Randy@randylusk.com\n\ud83d\udcf2 Cell: 443-535-1578 \n\u260e\ufe0f broker : 855-450-0442\t\n@realbrokerage\n\n#realestate #realtor #realestateagent #buyersagent #listingagent #MarylandRealEstate #onereal #realbroker",
