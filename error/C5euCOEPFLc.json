I wouldn\u2019t call this a vacation, but more like an expedition. I told my kids during dinner one night that I love them so much, I would die for them and then Ryder turned to me and said, \u201cbut dad, then who would guide us through life?\u201d\ud83e\udd79 While Ryder misunderstood me, I fully understand how much I mean to him. And that\u2019s all that matters. And it\u2019s what keeps me going. My life hasn\u2019t been about me in a long time, it\u2019s about them. I was supposed to be at LIV Miami this week, but I\u2019ll never miss time with my kids, golf will always be there for me. #DaddyGang #CBC",
