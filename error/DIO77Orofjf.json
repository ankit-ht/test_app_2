If it proceeds, OpenAI would become one of the largest storage consumers globally.\n\n \ud83d\udcbd AI requires massive storage: Training advanced models depends on massive volumes of data upheld by scalable mass-capacity storage infrastructure. OpenAI is reportedly considering up to 5 exabytes, reflecting the scale of modern AI workloads.\n\n \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Expanding infrastructure strategy: As part of its $500B Stargate data center project, OpenAI is evaluating dedicated storage facilities to complement its existing cloud partnerships.\n\n \u2696\ufe0f Balancing cost and performance: Managing storage in-house could improve efficiency, particularly for saving AI model checkpoints, which are essential for model iteration, showing how the model arrived at insights, and intellectual property protection.\n\n \u26a1Scaling compute power: OpenAI plans to triple its data center capacity this year, giving researchers 8 times more computing power to advance AI capabilities.\n\n \ud83d\udcc8 Rising storage demand: As AI models become more sophisticated, efficient, high-capacity storage will be increasingly critical to keeping pace with innovation.",
