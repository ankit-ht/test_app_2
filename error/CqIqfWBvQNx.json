Wald was the pioneering force behind the practice of community nursing. \n\nAfter working with struggling families in New York\u2019s Lower East Side, she started the Visiting Nursing Service of New York to bring affordable healthcare to the neighborhood. \n\nFrom there, she dedicated her life to activism, campaigning for women\u2019s suffrage, and supporting racial integration. \n\nShe also co-founded the Henry Street Settlement, a non-profit organization that continues to provide social services, arts programs, and healthcare to New Yorkers of all ages to this day. \n\n#NoticeTheNurses #WomensHistoryMonth",
