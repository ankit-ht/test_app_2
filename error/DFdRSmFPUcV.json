For Jess, race day is the fun part. That\u2019s when her hard work gets put to the test. \n\nBut after spending years climbing the global ranks on the track, Jess\u2019s ability to run at full strength was suddenly taken from her. Last year, the four-time British champion was diagnosed with epilepsy, a brain condition that causes recurring seizures. \n\nThough the diagnosis cut her Olympic year short, Jess was able to receive treatment and ultimately return to the sport with a new perspective. Now, she\u2019s racing with more joy and motivation than ever before. Learn about Jess\u2019s incredible comeback on the blog, available to read at the link in bio. \n\n#FlyHumanFly",
