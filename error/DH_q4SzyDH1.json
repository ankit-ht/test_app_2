They don\u2019t hang you because you're a Baptist; they hang you because you\u2019re Black!\"\u2060\n\u2060\n\ud83d\udce2 Malcolm X urged the Black community to use the ballot wisely. Demand real change from politicians or refuse to support those who don\u2019t serve Black interests. His message remains as relevant today as it was in 1964.\u2060\n\u2060\n\u270a\ud83c\udffe Do you think his words still apply today?
