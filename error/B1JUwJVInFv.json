This was no easy task because every muscle and tendon around his knee was ripped off completely and the skin and most of the muscles were gone. The surgeons took skin from his upper legs on both sides to reconstruct new skin over his lower leg.\n\nIt took two years of practice and physical therapy before he was able to walk without crutches. Some of us can relate to this story of tragedy and courage but all us can be inspired by people like Jean that never say die.\n\nIn the last words Jean wrote me today in a mail : Life can suck... but if you really want... success is around the corner.\n\nJean happy cycling mate, we look forward to see what you get up to next.\n\nYou can follow Jean here on Instagram @jeanbiermans74\n\n#cycling #cyclinglife #roadbike #isaacmeson \ud83d\udcf8 @Irmokeizer",
