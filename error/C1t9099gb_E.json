I want my LOVE for them to live LONGER than my physical presence ever could. \n\nI\u2019m focused on sacrificing comfort for bigger future wins no matter what it may look like externally. \n\nI\u2019m focused on being perfectly content without a \u201ctheme\u201d for this year\u2026 but instead just keeping my head down and letting the work speak for itself. \n\nMay God be Glorified in it all. \n\n#2024 #blacklawyers #Fitness #Motivation #MomLife",
