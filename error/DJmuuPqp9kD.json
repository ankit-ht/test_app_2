The group wants to be the next big Porsche event, and it\u2019s already off to a running start by hosting what they claim to be the largest gathering of Carrera GTs ever. The second installment of Pl\u00e1tica took place on May 4th and while there were 65 Porsches on display at the show, the big draw was a collection of 18 Carrera GTs.\n\nHow would you spec your dream Carrera GT?\n\n#CarreraGT #CGT #V10 #savethemanuals #supercar #carsofinstagram #cargram #roadandtrack\nPhotos by @rileypkng",
