With a history dating back to The Romans, we loved exploring the vibrant town centre, with its colourful houses, narrow alleys, cute bakeries, wonderful cheese & chocolate shops, ceramics and artist studios, cafes and restaurants. \r\n\r\nThe 10th century benedictine Abbey of Saint-Philibert de Tournus is a must visit! We also recommend a visit to H\u00f4tel-Dieu - a hospital (now museum) built in the 17th century with a lovely garden.\r\n\r\nOther highlights included\u2026\r\n\r\n\ud83e\uddc0 Lunch @lerelaisdozenay -where the chef champions local producers including ceramics artists, cheese makers and regional wine makers. \r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf77 Dinner Clo\u00eetre restaurant @hotel_spa_les7fontaines by chef @stephane_gregoire.69 - where traditional Burgundy dishes have been re-invented with a modern twist.\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfe8 Overnight stay and lovely breakfast @hotel_spa_les7fontaines - loved our massive suite, overlooking the sunny courtyard and huge bathrooms with roll top bathtubs. Also just a stone's throw away from the local village shops and cafes too.\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd42 Wine tasting @lesvigneronsdemancey - an immersive and interactive experience, learning all about the soil, climate, scents and smells of the local wines and vineyards. \r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Lunch at 1 Michelin starred Les Terrasses restaurant by chef Jean-Michel Carrette @auxterrasses_jm_carrette - An absolutely delicious lunch here! The market menu changes daily, using seasonal ingredients from local farmers and followed by desserts in the beautiful garden terrace - full of herbs and flowers.\r\n\r\nThank you to my wonderful hosts! @tournustourisme @bourgognefranchecomte_tourisme @mybourgogne @valleedelagastronomie @explorefrance \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\u2764\ufe0f\r\n\r\nad / invite - #tournustourisme #labourgogne #valleedelagastronomie #ExploreFrance",
