They\u2019re also a chance to reflect, decompress, and show yourself some compassion. \n\nWhether a shift went smoothly or felt incredibly challenging, practicing rituals give us a chance to debrief with ourselves and reflect on what went well, and what could have been better.\n\nThroughout the summer, we\u2019ll be sharing simple self care tips to help you take better care of yourself, show yourself some kindness, and prevent burning out.\n\nThis week, we\u2019ve assembled some resources designed to help you practice rituals so you can decompress before transitioning from work to life.\n\nWhat is your favorite pre or post shift ritual? Tell us in the comments below.",
