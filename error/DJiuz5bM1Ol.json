It\u2019s still sleeping.\nWhich means\u2026 you\u2019re still early.\n\nThen comes the altcoin pump\u2014\nNot the little bounce we saw last year.\nThe real alt season.\nThe one where solid projects explode 10x, 20x, even more\u2026\nand portfolios double overnight.\n\nAfter that, the market breathes.\nIt cools off.\nPeople get shaken out.\nSome give up too soon.\n\nBut the smart ones?\nThey wait.\n\nBecause next comes the microcaps.\nThe forgotten gems.\nThe ones no one was talking about\u2014\nuntil they 50x.\n\nAnd sometimes, the memes go nuclear.\n(Though this cycle\u2019s been weird\u2014memes moved early. Still\u2026 it\u2019s not over.)\n\nThen\u2014comes the crash.\nThe correction.\nThe reality check.\nIt\u2019s brutal. And it wipes out the greedy.\n\nAnd maybe\u2026 just maybe\u2026\nit takes the world with it\u2014\ninto recession, by the end of 2026.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:\nEvery step of this cycle is predictable\u2014if you know what to look for.\nAnd every step is a chance to change your future.\n\nImagine using this next run to\u2026\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Pay off your debt\n\ud83d\udd25 Buy your freedom\n\ud83d\udd25 Help your family\n\ud83d\udd25 Buy back your time and take a gap year from work \n\ud83d\udd25 Build real wealth for your future\n\nThat\u2019s the real power of crypto.\n\nAnd yes\u2014it can feel overwhelming.\nWallets. Coins. Security.\nWhat to buy, when to sell, how not to get wrecked\u2026\n\nI get it.\nThat\u2019s why I built my Crypto Academy\u2014\nTo walk you through it all, step by step.\n\nIf you want to build a portfolio the right way\u2014\nDM me or click the link in my bio to get started.\n\nYou\u2019ve just been given the roadmap.\nNow it\u2019s time to decide:\nWill you watch it happen again\u2026 or finally take the wheel?",
