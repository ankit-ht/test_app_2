Highlights from our time there included\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2713 A private tour of @grottechauvet2 - where we learned all about the first cave art - made over 36,000 years ago \r\n\r\n\u2713 Lunch with the locals at Auberge la Farigoule - a charming bistrot overlooking vineyards and lavender fields, serving hearty dishes and fantastic desserts.\r\n\r\n\u2713 The most incredible Speleoenology experience @grottesaintmarcel - where we ventured deep into the natural caves and did a blind wine tasting of local wines - including wines aged inside the cave. We also came across some beautiful natural cave pools, which were illuminated by a magical light show.\r\n\r\n\u2713 Super fun wine tasting experience at @domaine_les_amoureuses - where they make some incredible wines aged in amphora. We also loved the local olive oils, chestnut purees and honey. \r\n\r\n\u2713 A beautiful alfresco dinner, wine and cheese tasting experience, plus an overnight stay @domainedecousignac run by the inspirational organic winemaker Raphael Pommier, where wines are aged with music. Working with local artists and musicians, there is even a different piece of music for each wine blend, composed every year.\r\n\r\nThank you to my wonderful hosts! @ardechetourisme @gorges_ardeche @auvergnerhonealpes.tourisme @valleedelagastronomie @explorefrance\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\u2764\ufe0f\r\n\r\nad / invite - #gorgesdelardeche #ExploreAuvergneRhoneAlpes #valleedelagastronomie #ExploreFrance",
