Women began posting black and white photos of themselves due to the frustration of seeing obit photos of women (usually b&w).\n.\nThe idea is that by posting a photo of you in b&w you are showing solidarity with them, demanding change and a voice to the voiceless. These women are your sisters. Bring them back to life by sharing their story as many men still disregard their worth and ours.\n.\nInstagram challenges often mutate over time, but We see the love and support for one another with this one. Even if ppl may not recognize it\u2019s original meaning. Stand for your girlfriends and women across the globe. Include the hashtags when sharing your B&W photo:\n\n#femicide.\n#feminism.\n#womenempoweringwomen.\n#sisterhood.\n#kad\u0131na\u015fiddetehay\u0131r.\n#istanbuls\u00f6zle\u015fmesiya\u015fat\u0131r.\n.\nWe\u2019re so grateful to the amazing women who make up our @bombaybrowbar community. We love you from the inside out. Let\u2019s spread more love and support to women and women-led businesses. @strippedwaxbar you\u2019re next! Post a photo in black and white with the words Challenge Accepted, include awareness about this challenge, then pass it on to another woman-led business to do the same.\ud83d\udc9elet\u2019s keep this going and share our support for the voiceless.",
