  "caption": "A judge has opened criminal proceedings against Real Madrid player Raul Asencio and three other former Real Madrid academy players in connection with the recording and distribution of s*xual images of two women. \n\nOne of the girls was only 16 years old, with the suspects including Raul Asencio being 20 and 21 years old.\n\nAs of today, the girl suffers from post-traumatic stress resulting from what happened.\n\nThe formal indictment by a Spanish court means the case is moving towards a potential trial. The players are accused of charges that may include unlawful disclosure of secrets, violation of privacy, and potentially offenses related to the involvement of a minor.\n\nAsencio has publicly addressed the allegations and denies significant involvement in the recording and distribution of the images.\n\nAccording to Asencio, the court order suggests his potential involvement was limited to the \"possible momentary viewing of some images by a third party,\" and it does not attribute to him any participation in their recording or dissemination. He has also stated that he was not the one who sent any intimate images or videos to third parties.",
