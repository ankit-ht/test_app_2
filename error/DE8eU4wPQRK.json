Enter escargot, that celebrated French delicacy, a little jewel of a dish, drenched in garlic, butter, and the kind of indulgence that whispers of far-off Parisian nights. After a recent sojourn in France, we at LUSH felt compelled to share this culinary treasure. Imagine, if you will, tender snails luxuriating in a butter infused with garlic, lemon, parsley, white wine, and just a hint of black pepper\u2014a rich, comforting embrace that requires no passport, only a willingness to savor.\n\nBut perhaps snails are not your preference. No matter. For those who shy away from the thought of such creatures, we present the \u201cescar-NO\u201d option. Here, we substitute juicy chicken thighs, gently poached in that same sumptuous butter. The effect is nearly identical\u2014a harmonious symphony of flavors, but with a more familiar, approachable centerpiece.\n\nWhether you lean toward the adventurous or the traditional, your palate is in for a journey. Come to LUSH and let us whisk you away to the charm of a Parisian bistro, one buttery morsel at a time. We won\u2019t pry into your choice; we\u2019ll simply delight in your enjoyment. After all, fine dining, like fine living, is about the pleasure of the experience.",
