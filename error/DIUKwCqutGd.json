  "caption": "I\u2019m all in on making real estate listings more transparent. Every buyer should be able to see every home for sale\u2014no hidden inventory, no insider access required. \n\nWhen listings are open, buyers win with better choices, sellers win with fair competition, and prices stay honest. This move pushes the industry forward and opens the door wider for more people to become homeowners. I\u2019m watching to see which brokerage steps up next. \n\nSellers deserve the full truth\u2014not advice that keeping a home off-market will get them more money, when the data says otherwise. Transparency isn\u2019t about forcing anyone\u2019s hand. It\u2019s about making sure buyers and sellers have real choices and fewer regrets.\n\n#exp #zillow #compassrealestate #transparency",
