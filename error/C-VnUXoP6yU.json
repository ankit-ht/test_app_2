There\u2019s also a medley of natural oils to help the skin stay hydrated, but without the odor those oils sometimes bring. \u2018You can even use it on your lips to remove lipstick, and there\u2019s no weird taste or smell,\u2019 our product tester noted. Applying it couldn\u2019t be simpler: just soak a cotton pad in it and gently swipe anywhere you want to remove dirt and makeup. \u2018It\u2019s also less greasy than a typical makeup remover, so you can wear it daily\u2014and even under makeup,\u2019 she added.\u201d\n\nThank you, @thebump, for naming E-Rase the best pregnancy-safe makeup remover! Great for all skin, pregnant or not, and no rinsing required! \n\nRead the full review via link in bio.",
