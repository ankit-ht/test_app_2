It is a form of traditional Vietnamese formalwear \u2014 consisting of a long tunic (split at the sides) worn over a pair of wide-legged silk trousers \ud83d\udc56\n\n\u00c1o d\u00e0i was born in the 18th century by the Nguy\u1ec5n lords in Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n \u2014 but the modern + more form-fitting version that we know now was popularized in the 1930s, heavily influenced by French haute couture. While typically depicted on women, \u00e1o d\u00e0i can be worn by all genders!\n\nWe love wearing our \u00e1o d\u00e0i to temple to celebrate the New Year \u2014 but they can generally be worn to all sorts of special occasions, like weddings or holiday celebrations \ud83c\udfee Happy Year of the Dragon \ud83d\udc32\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Celebrating T\u1ebft in Southern California\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Vanessa + Papa Pham in Saigon\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Mama + Papa Pham lookin\u2019 like royalty\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Papa Pham rocking a modern version over his black jeans lol\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Vanessa + Kim as kiddos",
