I\u2019m absolutely thrilled to share that after 5 years in real estate, I\u2019ve joined Compass and the incredible Colleen Hadden Group! Growing up in Bucks County and moving to New Jersey over ten years ago, I am deeply committed to serving our South Jersey and Philadelphia neighborhoods. I\u2019m a proud member of the Merchantville community, and my involvement in the school\u2019s PTA and clubs are allowing me to create strong connections within our community and gain valuable insights into our area\u2019s unique needs.\nJoining The Colleen Hadden Group was an easy choice for me. This team embodies everything I believe in - genuine care for our clients and a steadfast commitment to delivering exceptional service. Their unwavering focus on putting our clients\u2019 needs first truly resonates with me. And being part of a supportive group of women who prioritize both their clients and their families is incredibly inspiring. I\u2019m beyond excited for this new chapter and the opportunity to continue serving you all with the utmost care and expertise. Whether you\u2019re looking to buy, sell, or just want to chat about the real estate market, I\u2019m here for you every step of the way.\n\nWelcome to the team, @leahsmithrealtor\n\ud83d\udcf1215.771.5651\n\ud83d\udc8c leahsmith@compass.com\n\n#leahsmithrealtor #thecolleenhaddengroup #compassnewjersey #newteammember #welcome  #parealtor #southjerseyrealtor #southjerseyrealestate #southjersey #supportlocal #communityconnections",
