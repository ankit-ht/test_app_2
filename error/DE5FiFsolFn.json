  "caption": "As a good rule of thumb, you should always check your skincare products\u2019 expiry date and PAO, period after opening. \nAll of our products contain natural preservatives which can prolong their shelf life, so they are safe to use even a little after expiration, but you should also keep in mind that all beauty products expire, even if they have not been opened, and those, too, you should discard. \n\nExpired skincare or makeup can cause redness, breakouts, irritation or just lose the potency of the results they would normally deliver. Check for the open-jar symbol on the back of your products: the number on it indicates its shelf life.",
