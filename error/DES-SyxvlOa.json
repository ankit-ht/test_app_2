But my God. \ud83d\ude02 From dancing in Brussels with Hair Nah showing at the Bozar to singing in Barcelona, hanging with my friends. Seeing my family in London being reunited with my heels! Going through natural disasters. Being flooded twice and leaving to get blessed with an even bigger lofted space!! Broke my other foot. My friends helped present Hair Nah at the Smithsonian museum! I gave a bunch of talks and was a guest lecturer. Music was present in my life. I rapped a bit the year. Had a band and dressed to the 9s. \n\n2025 is already starting off great and I'm excited for the changes and continued elevation. But super grateful for my growth in 24 and those who helped both friends and foes. My block list got longer. My goals list grew stronger. Oh the goals I have! Happy New Year everyone! \u2728 I hope your heart is a bit brighter and lighter.",
