TP South was actually where I played my first ever round of 18 about 4 months ago, but this time was much different\u2026 1. It was pouring rain for 13 or more holes and I\u2019ve never played in the rain before. 2. Last 2 Malbon tourneys I played in were Scramble & Shamble, this time it was Best Shot. 3. I been practicing 4-6 times a week since then and the end result?  I shot 27 strokes better than my last time! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude2d I was LOCKED THE FUCK IN! My game and confidence has changed a lot just in the last week. I love meeting new friends/golfers who love this game as much as I do and just being able to be on a golf course is a blessing. This is by far the greatest & hardest game in the world and I can\u2019t wait to break 80 and then hopefully 70 and travel the world to play at every dream course there is. Big shout out to @stephenmalbon for not just blessing me with gear, but for introducing me to @rdbgolftips \ud83d\udc10 Thank you Luke and the entire Malbon Team \ud83d\udc9a\nOf course thank you to my sponsor @taylormadegolf and the entire TM staff especially @the_stranger @trottiegolf\nThank you @gregmanleygolf for the rain gloves! They saved me! Thank god I stopped by the Kingdom! And thanks for all the encouragement and hate from the golf community, It\u2019s fueled me to get better and better and nothing will stop my competitive spirit and drive! Love \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd #TheWashedLord  #TeamTaylormade #KoreanRoyMcAvoy \u26f3\ufe0f\ud83c\udfcc\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\ud83d\udcf8: @padronsmoker",
