And a big happy birthday to Raul \u2013 hope it\u2019s a great one! \ud83c\udf89\n\nIt\u2019s always nice to step away from our desks, share a bite, and enjoy each other\u2019s company, without discussing work. \ud83d\ude09 These moments remind us how important it is to pause, connect, and celebrate as a team. \ud83d\udcac\u2615\ufe0f\n\nBig thanks to everyone who helped put it together - and to our amazing team for making it so fun. Until the next one! \ud83d\udc99\n\n#CompanyTraditions #EasterBreakfast #WorkCulture",
