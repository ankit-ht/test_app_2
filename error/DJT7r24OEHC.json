The opening reception is next Sunday 5/18 from 2-5PM.\n\nThis piece is named after the poem by Naomi Replansky. \n\nThe poem begins with, \u201cI met my Solitude. We two stood glaring.\nI had to tremble, meeting her face to face.\nThen she saying, and I with bent head hearing:\n\u201cYou sent me forth to exile and disgrace,\n \n\u201cMost faithful of your friends, then most forsaken,\nForgotten in breast, in bath, in books, in bed.\nTo someone else you gave the gifts I gave you,\nAnd you embraced another in my stead.\u2026\u201d\n\n#art #poetry #artandpoetry #visualpoetry #collage #handcutcollage #cutandpaste #cutandpastecollage #papercut #contemporarycollage #kolaj #kolajmagazine #contemporarycollagemagazine #arte #narrativeart",
