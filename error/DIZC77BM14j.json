She said, \u201cI was baking a tray of brownies this morning, something I never would have done a few months ago, and it hit me\u2014I didn\u2019t even want to lick the bowl. Not one part of me craved it. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I never would have thought that would have been possible.  It\u2019s stories like this that make my work so rewarding. If you\u2019re looking for good freedom, reach out to me. It is absolutely possible for you too.",
