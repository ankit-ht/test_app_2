  "caption": "The Tecton X 3 is the most advanced trail running footwear we've ever made, with two layers of PEBA in the midsole, dual carbon plates and a @Vibram Megagrip outsole for the gnarliest terrain. Topping it all off is a new upper design with a knit collar to mitigate trail debris. Don\u2019t miss your chance to own this amazing piece of technology in a limited-edition color that matches the kits our elite athletes will be racing in at the @utmbmontblanc. \n\nAvailable only at HOKA Base Camp in Chamonix on Wednesday, August 28th starting at 9 a.m. Don't wait, these shoes are designed to go fast \ud83d\udca8 \n\n#UTMBWorldSeries #UTMBWorld #UTMBMontBlanc #HOKA #FlyHumanFly",
