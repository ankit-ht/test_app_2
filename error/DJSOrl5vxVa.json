If you are new to Retinol, start by using the product every other day or a few times a week to evaluate your skin\u2019s response and then gradually increase usage.\n\nPowered by Triple Hyaluronic Acid, RoC Retinol, and Swertiamarin, this lightweight serum sinks into the skin instantly to plump skin and fill in the look of wrinkles so they\u2019re less noticeable in the mirror. \ud83e\ude9e\u2728",
