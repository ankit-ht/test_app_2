Yesterday my hair was straight. Today bounced right back to curly with the help of this beautiful combination.\n\nAfter applying these on soaking wet hair I then smoothed in Papaya Slip Taming Potion \ud83e\uddea and then the Bamboo Ginseng Curling Glaze. Diffused on high and left most of the cast in.\n\nI took 2 years to test and develop these formulations. Green chemistry keeps evolving so I have the opportunity to bring only the best most efficacious ingredients that are high performing and reliable for you always. \n\nI hope you find this helpful. Any questions drop them below.\n\nWith love,\n\nKeisha Jo xx\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n#trepadoracurltherapy #curlyhair #curlscurlscurls #curl #curlscurlfordays #curlpower #heatprotection #scalpcare",
