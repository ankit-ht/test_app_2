You\u2019ll leave with a clearer sense of how to get your business online quickly, easily, and without needing a background in tech.\n\nThis session is part of our Business Basics Bootcamp series, offered through the Business Hub with support from the @mainetechnologyinstitute. It will be led by Nick Rimsa, a Portland-based designer who has helped launch over 50 products and worked with small businesses across Maine.\n\nJoin us Thursday, May 1 from 3:00 to 5:00 PM at 24 Preble Street, 3rd floor. Interpretation available.\n\nRegister through the link in our bio!",
