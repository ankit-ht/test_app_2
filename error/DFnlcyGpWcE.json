  "caption": "February is #BlackHistoryMonth, sometimes called Black Futures Month, a time to acknowledge that the story of Black people in the US is still being written, and find ways to honor the many successes and contributions of African-Americans both in the past and today. \n\nSwipe for ideas on how to increase your understanding of the Black experience in the US.\n\nIf you identify as Black, focusing on Black history may feel inspiring or healing, or because the history of Black people in the US contains so much injustice, focusing on it can bring up challenging emotions. All of these feelings are valid, and you can choose to engage, or not, in whatever way feels right to you.",
