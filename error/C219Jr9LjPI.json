There is a James Bond like mystique attached to these incredible outposts that have offered shelter and warmth to many  weary travellers for centuries. Even Napoleon himself was given two glasses of wine and some bread by the monks of the Great Saint Bernard hospice when he arrived there in 1800. For many, the most symbolic aspect of a mountain is the peak because it is believed that it is closest to heaven or other religious realms which drew these brave men to the Alpine. I wanted to create a series of heroic portraits to celebrate the men and women of the cloth whose lives are devoted to their faith and often in today\u2019s lightning fast society are forgotten. Inspired by historical images I found of nuns skiing in the Scandinavian mountains and paintings of monks on skis at the St Bernard pass I have created a series of images that holds a special place in my heart. \nThis first piece from the series is produced in three sizes and was of course shot in my beloved St Moritz. A picture perfect day with blue skys and a foot of fresh snow gave me the canvas I had been waiting for!
