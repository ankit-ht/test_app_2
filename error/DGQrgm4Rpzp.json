Over the past 10 years (\ud83e\udd2f), one of the biggest lessons I\u2019ve learned is the priceless value of community. My sanity has been kept intact thanks to the Black founders in my circle who remind me that I\u2019m not alone in this journey. We\u2019re all facing similar challenges, and we can navigate them more effectively together.\n\nIssa Rae once said it best, \u201cWe have a tendency to try to network up, but it\u2019s really about networking across. Who\u2019s next to you? Who\u2019s struggling? Who\u2019s in the trenches with you? Build with them.\u201d There\u2019s so much power in building with our peers.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m so proud to introduce the OBWS Founders Club\u2014a community for ambitious Black entrepreneurs (& aspiring founders) to intentionally connect, share resources, support, and uplift each other. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\n\nIf you\u2019re a Black founder or aspiring founder looking for a supportive network, real connections, and access to resources, this is for you. Learn more and apply through the link in my bio or at founders.obws.com \n\nAnddd if you\u2019d like to partner on events, workshops, provide resources, or anything in between, hit me up! \n\nSee you in the clurb \u270c\ud83c\udffe #OBWSFoundersClub",
