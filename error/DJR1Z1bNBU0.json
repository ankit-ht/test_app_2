We found solutions together. We dined together. We knew each other\u2019s families\u2026how could I leave them?\n\nMoreover, leaving the financial security of corporate life required a lot of faith, because there was no safety net.\n\nIf I failed, I would land right on my butt!\n\nBut what if I hadn\u2019t decided to bet on myself? \ud83d\udca1\n\nWhere would I be five years later?\n\nI can only speculate, but I think my speculations are close to accurate:\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdI would have still been an Administrative Assistant. I would have missed out on partnering with some phenomenal people to help them achieve their incredible dreams, because I would have still been sitting behind a desk, booking lunch dates, screening phone calls, filing expense reports, and playing a bit character in someone else\u2019s dream.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdI would have missed out on writing my first book and being featured in magazines and podcasts. No one would have had the chance to hear and apply my theories on: creating a lifestyle that fulfills you, the necessary steps to take before setting goals, or how to reimagine how you show up in this world.\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffdI would still be living the lifestyle that I help others escape. Chasing promotions that never come, fitting my life into someone else\u2019s box, dimming my light so others would find me palatable, and showing up inauthentically to maintain some sense of safety.\n\nThat one decision helped me evolve in ways I never imagined!\n\nLook, I can promise you this, if you don\u2019t decide to do something different...\n\nWe'll be having the same conversation, five years from now.\n\nHowever, one phone call could open up a world you never imagined.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your vision and what\u2019s standing in the way. Book a Jumpstart Your Success Strategy Session.\n\nLink in my bio.\n\n#futurefocused #coachingforleaders #intentionalgrowth #midlife",
