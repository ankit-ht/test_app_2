Our Gut Builder supplement has thoughtfully combined ingredients like L-glutamine, fiber, marshmallow, ginger, and pomegranate to support the GI tract and optimize digestive well-being.\n \nL-glutamine is the primary fuel source for enterocytes (the cells that line the intestines).\n \nFiber acts as a fuel source for members of the gut microbiome (bacteria that live in the gut).\n \nMarshmallow is a demulcent herb, meaning it contains mucilage (a gel-like substance) that can coat and soothe the lining of the GI tract.\n \nGinger is a great anti-inflammatory herb that can soothe symptoms of indigestion and nausea and stimulate digestive enzymes.\n \nPomegranates are packed with antioxidants and can be metabolized by the gut microbiome to produce anti-inflammatory molecules.\n \nSpeak to your health care provider to learn about which supplements are right for your unique health goals and concerns.\n \nPMID: 28498331\nPMID: 36557760\n \n#codexlabs #guthealth #digestivehealth #guthealthsupplements #gutmicrobiome",
