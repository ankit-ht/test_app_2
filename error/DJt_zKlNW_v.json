Follow @vexking for words of wisdom like the ones below! \ud83c\udf1f\u2063\n.\n\u201cWe are not placed on this Earth to endure harm\u2014no matter who it comes from. Love does not ask us to shrink beneath cruelty. Spirituality does not ask us to excuse what wounds and weathers our well-being.\n.\nSometimes, the people closest to us\u2014those we are taught to revere without question\u2014are the very ones who cause the deepest harm. Family ties can be sacred, but they are not a free pass for abuse, manipulation, or emotional neglect.\n.\nPretending someone\u2019s harmful behaviour is acceptable only extends the cycle of suffering. It teaches us to betray ourselves in the name of loyalty.\u2063 You are allowed to draw a sacred line. You are allowed to protect your peace\u2014even if that means creating distance from those who refuse to honour it.\u2063\n.\nCutting ties with a family member is not a failure of love\u2014it is often the greatest act of self-love. It is the soul\u2019s quiet rebellion against patterns that were never meant to be carried forward.\u2063\n.\nBoundaries provide clarity. They are the prayer that says: \u201cI will no longer sacrifice my wellness for someone else\u2019s unwillingness to love me in the way I deserve.\u201d\n.\nIf you need to walk away from continued harm, do it with no regrets. Grieve if you must, heal at your own pace, but know this\u2014you are not wrong for choosing yourself.\u2063\n.\nYou were never meant to suffer endlessly, regardless of whether it\u2019s your \u201cfamily.\u201d You were meant to live, to expand, to embody love\u2014and sometimes, love means letting go.\u2063\u2013#VexKing",
