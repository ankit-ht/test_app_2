This collection of show-stopping accessories reimagines the glamor of Studio54 through a decidedly Vitaly lens, pairing lavish design cues with the energy of the punk movement \u2014 a subculture that was gaining momentum in NYC during this same time period. When designing this collection, we challenged ourselves to consider what it would look like if the punks infiltrated Studio54, bypassing the lines and celebrities, crashing high-society\u2019s most notable party. What would happen if the ostentatious jewelry of the era was recontextualized through a punk lens? The result is our take on opulence \u2014 a collection that is just as rebellious as it is luxurious.\n\nShop the first drop now at vitalydesign.com",
