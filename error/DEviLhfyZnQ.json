Seeing the small acts of kindness and community, people looking for ways to help and support those who are suffering is amazing. \n\nPrelove You is accepting gently used children\u2019s wear and shipping them to families in need in Los Angeles. We are happy to do the smallest of parts by being a drop off location for them! \n\nIf you have a children\u2019s clothing donation feel free to drop it off Tuesday-Saturday at The Artist House. Any bit can help! \n\n#somersny #westchesterny #newyork",
