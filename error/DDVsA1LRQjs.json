I fed Mabel and her mom three times per day. They both thanked me before and after every meal. \n\nI saw that Mabel had a kindness to her and knew she could possibly be someone\u2019s indoor kitty one day, so a few weeks ago, I decided to set a trap and she calmly walked right in. \n\nI had no idea how special she was until I spent the last few weeks with her. I will miss her dearly but I know she will be going to a great new home. \n\nThere is a waiting list for her because she is absolutely the dreamiest cat anyone could ever be lucky to share a life with. This will be a contest for who can offer her the best, most loving, safest home. \n\nIf you want a loving, super affectionate lap cat who will also play like crazy and make you laugh; a cat so smart and smushy you will be the envy of all of your friends; a cat who will talk to you when you need a friend, Mabel is your baby. \n\nMabel is approximately 5 months old now. She has already been spayed and she will be fully vaccinated and ready for her new family before Christmas.\n\nMabel would prefer to live by herself or with a male dog or cat. \n\nShe is still very scared of everyday normal things and will need time to decompress. \n\nShe also will 100% run outside and needs to be confined to a room or section of the home for at least a few more weeks. \n\nShe will need to be watched as she is a good hider and a fast runner. She needs to feel safe and wants you to sit with her when she eats. \n\nShe also thanks you for feeding her by kissing you, giving you head butts, and lots of rubs and purrs before she takes a bite. \n\nShe answers to the name, \u201cMama.\u201d \n\nAdoption form here: https://www.northportcatrescue.org/",
