For the last 5 years, I\u2019ve been cross-referencing research to make sure the advice we follow actually applies to us, ladies.\n\nHere are 5 trends that are bs \ud83d\udc47\n\n\u274c Trend #1: Intermittent Fasting every day!\n\nWomen\u2019s bodies are more sensitive to energy deficits. Daily fasting can lower kisspeptin\u2014a molecule that regulates GnRH \u2192 LH/FSH \u2192 ovulation.\nTranslation? You could suppress your cycle, slow your metabolism, and increase belly fat.\n\n\u2705 Better: Fast in your follicular phase. How? More on that in my cycle syncing @bestie.app! \n\ud83d\udcda Harvard Med (2013)\n\n\u274c Trend #2: Ice Baths\n\nCold plunges are great for dopamine\u2026 but timing matters.\nIn menstruating women, constant cold exposure activates norepinephrine and cortisol \u2192 can lead to adrenal fatigue over time if you\u2019re already stressed, under-eating, or over-training.\n\n\u2705 Better: Cold exposure 1\u20132x/week in your follicular phase, not every day. In luteal? Prioritize heat therapy (saunas, baths, walking outside).\n\ud83d\udcda Kregel et al., 2002:\n\n\u274c Trend #3: Replacing Meals with Green Juice\n\nUncooked cruciferous veggies like raw kale and broccoli contain goitrogens\u2014that inhibit iodine uptake, which can reduce thyroid hormone production (extra fat storage!)\n\n\u2705 Better: lightly cook your greens\u2014this reduces goitrogens by up to 80%. (Also in my @bestie.app!!!)\n\ud83d\udcda Rose et al., 1995 and Gunnars, 2013\n\n\u274c Trend #4: Low-Fat Everything\n\nYour hormones are literally built from cholesterol.\nGoing too low-fat = your body can\u2019t produce enough estrogen, progesterone, or cortisol and worsen PMS.\n\n\u2705 Better: Eat fats from egg yolks, grass-fed butter, fatty fish, and olive oil. Especially critical in luteal phase.\n\ud83d\udcda Wang et al., 2000:\n\n\u274c Trend #5: HIIT & running\n\nDaily HIIT depletes progesterone, which worsens PMS, sleep, and even fat loss resistance. Plus it leads to type 2 muscle fiber burnout\u2014these are your power, strength, and longevity fibers.\n\n\u2705 Better: Lift heavy in your follicular and ovulatory phases. Walk, stretch, or do Pilates luteally. Train like a woman in my @bestie.app \u2014not like a bootcamp bro.\n\n\ud83d\udcda Tomiyama, 2012",
