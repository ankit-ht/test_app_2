They both offer unlimited lifetime access including all future updates. (If you bought in the past, you get the 2025 updates for free!) If you\u2019re ready to get serious about investing for your future, check out my link in bio!\n\nI was inspired to make this post when I was thinking about those little \u201cinvestment amount\u201d sliders that you often see as part of the 401(k) enrollment process for new hires. You can just slide them back and forth to decide what percent of your income you want to put into your 401(k).\u200e\n\u200e\nI can picture the tens of thousands of young workers who are confronted with this slider daily. I imagine they look at it kind of confused, wondering what this 401k deal is and why they have to make this choice and also what\u2019s for lunch. \u200e\n\u200e\nBut what they don\u2019t realize is that sliding that little dial over to the right will buy them YEARS of their freedom in the future. In that moment they\u2019re making the decision between a little extra spending now or potentially decades of their life back in the future.\u200e\n\u200e\nYou have this choice too! Every day, week, and month when you\u2019re spending today, you\u2019re missing out on the opportunity to invest that money and let it GROW into even more in the future. That additional money can buy you years of freedom of choice about what you with your time!\u200e\n\u200e\nSlide that dial over to the right, then meet me on your yacht in a few more years! \u200e\n\u200e\nAs always, reminding you to build wealth by following the two PFC rules: 1.) Live below your means and 2.) Invest early and often.\u200e\n\u200e\n-Jeremy\u200e\n\n#investing #401k #personalfinance",
