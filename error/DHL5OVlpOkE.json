Frieda\u2019s journey into reproductive health was sparked by a pivotal summer spent shadowing a midwife. Reflecting on that experience, Frieda shared, \u201cSeeing how she connected with and supported her patients during those really crucial moments of fear and anxiety and joy and transition, it was what really inspired me to apply to midwifery school.\u201d\n\n2025 scholarship applications will be accepted starting in the spring.
