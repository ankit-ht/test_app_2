Over the past 10 years (\ud83e\udd2f), one of the biggest lessons I\u2019ve learned is the priceless value of community. My sanity has been kept intact thanks to the Black founders in my circle who remind me that I\u2019m not alone in this journey. We\u2019re all facing similar challenges, and we can navigate them more effectively together.\n\nIssa Rae once said it best, \u201cWe have a tendency to try to network up, but it\u2019s really about networking across. Who\u2019s next to you? Who\u2019s struggling? Who\u2019s in the trenches with you? Build with them.\u201d There\u2019s so much power in building with our peers.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m so proud to introduce the OBWS Founders Club\u2014a community for ambitious Black entrepreneurs (& aspiring founders) to intentionally connect, share resources, support, and uplift each other. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\n\nIf you\u2019re a Black founder or aspiring founder looking for a supportive network, real connections, and access to resources, this is for you. Learn more and apply through the link in my bio or at founders.obws.com \n\nAnddd if you\u2019d like to partner on events, workshops, provide resources, or anything in between, hit me up! \n\nSee you in the clurb \u270c\ud83c\udffe #OBWSFoundersClub",

Under federal protection, they covered about 12 miles a day and slept in fields and makeshift camps along U.S. Route 80, enduring physical exhaustion and threats to demand equal voting rights for African Americans.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe march followed earlier attempts that were met with violent opposition, notably the events of \"Bloody Sunday\" on March 7, 1965, when peaceful protesters were brutally attacked at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Despite these challenges, the marchers persevered, and their efforts contributed significantly to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark achievement in the Civil Rights Movement. \u270a\ud83c\udffe #BlackHistory\u2060\n\u2060\nFollow @officialblackwallstreet for more Black excellence and Black-owned businesses.",

Enjoy a juicy Korean Bulgogi burger with a creamy, refreshing, crunchy sauce. \u2028\u2028\ud83c\udf54 Ingredients \ud83c\udf54\u2028\u2022 1 cup of Chobani\u00ae Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt\n\u2022 1 cup of shredded cucumbers\n\u2022 Handful of fresh dill\n\u2022 Pinch of salt\u00a0\n\u2022 Ground black pepper\n\u2022 1 tbsp olive oil\u00a0\n\u2022 1 toast\n\u2022 1/2 packet of Omsom Spicy Bulgogi Sauce\u00a0\n\u2022 150g (\u2154 cup) ground beef\n\u2022 1/3 tsp baking powder\n\u2022 Potato burger buns\n\u2022 Lettuce\n\u2022 Tomato\u00a0\n\n\ud83c\udf74 Directions \ud83c\udf74\u20281. Mix the ground beef with salt, pepper, and baking powder. Set aside.\n2. Shred the cucumbers and mix with \u00bd tsp of kosher salt. Set aside for 5 minutes.\u00a0\n3. Chop the dill into small pieces.\n4. Place the shredded cucumbers in a paper towel and squeeze out the excess water.\n5. In a bowl, mix the Greek Yogurt, cucumbers, dill, salt, and olive oil.\n6. Shape and press the ground beef into a patty, and cook both sides on a heated oiled pan for 2 minutes on each side, or until browned.\n7. Lower the heat to the lowest setting. Add \u00bd packet of Omsom Spicy Bulgogi sauce on top of the beef patty, and flip the patty several times while the sauce bubbles and glazes over the patty. For a well-done burger, lower the heat and put a lid on top of the pan for the meat to finish cooking.\n8. On toasted buns, stack the spicy bulgogi patty, spread some tzatziki sauce, add tomato slices and some lettuce. Enjoy!\n\nChef\u2019s Tip: For extra flavor, add a teaspoon of minced garlic to the tzatziki sauce before serving.\n\n#koreanfusion #koreanfood #lunarnewyear",

I have been very lucky to have incredible, incredible friends, a supportive family and the best boyfriend and then husband anyone could ask for, BUT I didn\u2019t have a group where I could openly share my struggles, discuss ways to improve my career, life and business and collaborate with others in a way that felt genuine, empowering and exciting.\n\nAnd I think a part of me felt like I needed to earn it on my own, to experience and work through the struggle by myself in order to be truly \u201csuccessful.\u201d Total hogwash.\n\nCommunity just hits different. And let\u2019s face it, sometimes our loved ones don\u2019t always want to hear about or even understand what we go through in certain phases of our life, whether it\u2019s starting law school, building a business or even becoming a new mom. That is where community comes in.\n\nSince I left Biglaw and went off on my own to start @flourishlawgroup and continue to build @wealthylawyersquad , I discovered the true power of community.\n\nThe conversations. The inspiration. And the support to keep going when it feels hard and you feel alone.\nOne of my favorite communities that I have joined is The Daily Drip.\n\nI am forever grateful to this community for the support they provide to me as a modern South Florida businesswoman.\n\nAnd, if you tell me there is a photoshoot involved, you better believe I\u2019ll be there! \n\nWhere are you finding your sense of community? I would love to know!\n\n#southfloridabusinesswoman #community #womeninbusiness #womenowned",

We are also adding real estate closings and title work as an additional practice area very soon. With over 20 years of experience in tax and trusts and estates, my law partner and I take a hands-on and personalized approach to planning for our clients. We have seen what happens when a person does not have effective estate planning in place and, as a result, our goal is to educate the community and provide top-notch services to make sure families protect their legacies. Our motto is that \u201cwe help families flourish at all stages of life.\u201d I am also the founder of The Wealthy Lawyer $quad, a community for law students and new lawyers, which provides programming, education and coaching for the law school process and the first years as an attorney, and focuses on developing confidence, healthy mindset, and strong mental wellbeing and creating a dream career and wealth. In the $quad, we have one coaching program specifically curated for law students called The Law School Success Blueprint and we are launching a separate coaching program curated for new lawyers called The Lawyer Success Blueprint. I am also the host of The Wealthy Lawyer $quad Podcast, where our mission is to provide content that inspires, empowers and supports law students and new lawyers who want to dream big and I strive to shake up the status quo of what it means to be a successful lawyer in today\u2019s world. I\u2019m also a wife, mom, and real estate investor and love to read, workout, travel, try new foods and talk about business and entrepreneurship.\nLauren Klein, Esq., LL.M.\nFlourish Law Group",

A will GUARANTEES that you will go through probate \u2014 all of which becomes public record and can involve a lot more taxes.\n\nThere were judges at the conference from Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties.\n\nIn Broward, the probate division is seeing a 40% increase in filings year-over-year while there hasn\u2019t been a budget for a new probate judge since 2000-2002.\n\nThe judges GENUINELY care about doing a great job and want this process to be better but they are COMPLETELY overloaded.\n\nThat\u2019s just another reason to avoid ever having to go through probate.\n\nThe conversations at the conference heavily focused around the transfer of property because SO MANY probates (last stats I\u2019ve seen say 70%) probates involve property.\n\nLegacies aren\u2019t built when everything is good \u2014 it\u2019s built in how the lows are prepared for.\n\nIf you want to learn more about how to protect your legacy, we interview experts and attorneys like @lawyerlaurenklein on our Legacy Show to help you handle these exact situations.\n\nComment VIDEO to check out our recent episodes.",

Wake up, step into natural light, walk barefoot, breathe deeply, these aren\u2019t trends, they\u2019re time-tested tools.\n \ud83e\uddd8\ud83c\udffd Build inner peace. Through prayer, pranayama, or Surya Namaskar, whatever helps you go inward.\n \ud83c\udf00 Reframe stress. It\u2019s not always a threat; it\u2019s often a challenge, inviting growth.\n \ud83d\udcda Keep learning. Stay open, stay humble, wisdom often comes from unexpected places.\n \ud83e\udd1d Connect and give. Whether through volunteering or simple kindness, acts of service are powerful medicine.\n \ud83c\udfa7 Guard your mind. Just like food, what you feed your mind matters; choose content that aligns with your values.\n \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Gratitude always. Especially on tough days. It shifts perspective, softens the heart, and brings clarity.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about a perfect routine. It\u2019s about returning to what\u2019s always worked.\n Small, consistent steps that help you evolve, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.\nHeal in India. Made in India. Rooted in India.\n\nWe\u2019ve also compiled a comprehensive booklet the Bharat Lifestyle Plan that was presented to our honourable Prime Minister for all of you to see, download, learn, share and implement in your lives.\n\nDownload your copy (available in Hindi, English, Marathi, Gujarati) from the link in bio.\n\n#BharatLifestyleTipsByLukeCoutinho #BharatDishByLukeCoutinho #MadeInIndiaHealInIndia #TeamLuke #BharatLifestyle #BharatDish",

They carried with them dreams, hopes, and an unwavering commitment to the safety of every single one of us.\n\nThey gave their lives for the peace we often take for granted, standing guard in the face of danger, knowing that each moment could be their last. And yet, they did it without hesitation, with unmatched courage, strength, and selflessness. Their sacrifices are beyond measure, and their bravery is a light that will forever guide us.\n\nAs we remember them today, I can\u2019t help but feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude and sorrow. Gratitude for their immense sacrifice, and sorrow for the lives they could have lived but didn\u2019t.\n\nRest in peace, heroes.

It uplifts your energy.\u26a1\n\nIt moves you from chaos to calm.\ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nLast year, I had the chance to visit a healing center in Switzerland, surrounded by nature, where I learned about Solfeggio frequencies from a truly gifted teacher. \n\nIt was amazing to understand how each frequency had a specific power. When I came back, I decided to delve deep into it & curate a playlist \ud83c\udfa7 of these frequencies for our team, clients, & community.\n\nThey aren\u2019t just sounds- they\u2019re frequencies & vibrations \ud83d\udd0a.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the fascinating part:\nOur cells \u2014 just like musical instruments \ud83c\udfbb \u2014 vibrate at certain frequencies.\nAnd when they\u2019re \u2018out of tune,\u2019 dis\u2019EASE\u2019 can follow \u26a0\ufe0f.\n\nWhat helps us move from a low vibrational state to a high vibrational state?\n\nPure gratitude. \ud83d\ude4f\nTime spent in nature. \ud83c\udf3c \nAnd powerful sound. \ud83c\udfbc\n\nSound healing isn\u2019t magic. \u2728\n\nIt will never work alone. It\u2019s supportive. It works with your nutrition, your mindset, your movement, and several other aspects of your lifestyle.\n\nI now recommend certain frequencies to my clients who are open to it, especially those dealing with chronic stress \ud83d\ude23, sleep issues \ud83d\udecc, or emotional heaviness. Because healing isn\u2019t just physical. It\u2019s vibrational, energetic, and intuitive.\n\nThere\u2019s a divine intelligence within us. \n\nSometimes, we just need to cut the noise \u274c\ud83d\udd0a & let the right frequencies in.\n\nDrop a \u2018HEAL\u2019 in the comments and I\u2019ll DM you Team Luke\u2019s Sound Medicine Healing Playlist \u2014 a 12-part Solfeggio series \ud83c\udfb5.\n\nThis might be the missing piece you didn\u2019t even know you were looking for.\n\n#SoundHealing #SolfeggioFrequencies #VibrationalHealing #HolisticHealing",

She was bullied at work, isolated socially & haunted by fears of not being accepted by a partner. Her self-worth was in pieces. One look at the mirror reminded her daily of what she had lost\u2014confidence, peace, joy.\n\nShe tried it all\u2014steroidal creams, homeopathy \ud83d\udc8a, Ayurveda. The effects? Temporary at best.\n\nShe had been quietly following our work on Instagram for years. Finally, she reached out\u2014with hope.

They work together as a team synergistically, along with calcium to keep your bones strong and healthy from childhood through the older years.\n\nIf we consume too much calcium without sufficient magnesium, Vitamin D3 & K2, the excess calcium is not utilized correctly and may actually become toxic, causing calcification of arteries, bone spurs and heart complications! \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\n\nSo, more calcium & dairy doesn\u2019t mean stronger, healthier bones. You need a healthy bone matrix for strong, young bones, which further determines your bone density and strength.\n\nIf you are on treatments like radiation, chemotherapy or taking medications, birth control pills, hormonal treatments, estrogen blockers then these too deteriorate bone density. Thus as a part of your strategy to manage side-effects, it\u2019s important to supplement or at least focus on food sources that make up your bone matrix. \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\n\t\u2022\tA point I missed - importance of sleep for bone health\u2026 deep restful sleep \ud83d\udca4 is when bones get stronger and processes like bone remodelling and repair occurs.\n\nEven if you have had a knee/hip replacement you still have to take care of your bones.\n\nA quality life as you age doesn\u2019t mean a good bank balance, access to insurance, doctors and other facilities, but also strong and healthy bones.\n\nBuild healthy bones because we will always need them.\n\nDisclaimer: For many medical conditions, you might be required to take calcium supplements. Speak to your doctor about supplements that do not just have calcium but the complete formulation that help build bone matrix.\n\n#BoneHealth #CalciumBalance #VitaminD3 #MagnesiumMatters #HealthyAging #BoneMatrix #LukeCoutinho",

It can be\u00a0all consuming and\u00a0when it hits I am\u00a0plagued with fatigue and emptiness. During that time\u00a0nothing seems to shine.\u00a0I\u2019m very lucky that I\u00a0always have\u00a0Mavi by my side begging for a walk or willing to cuddle when I am a prisoner to my bed. Together we always get to\u00a0the other side.\n\u00a0\nI partnered for #MentalHealthAwarenessMonth with @nulopetfood in support of the silent battle so many of us are fighting. Awareness is the first step,\u00a0then from there it\u2019s\u00a0dissolving the stigma that surrounds mental health and keeps us hiding our\u00a0private battles. If you are struggling- just know that you are not alone and there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.",

My sanity has been kept intact thanks to the Black founders in my circle who remind me that I\u2019m not alone in this journey. We\u2019re all facing similar challenges, and we can navigate them more effectively together.\n\nIssa Rae once said it best, \u201cWe have a tendency to try to network up, but it\u2019s really about networking across. Who\u2019s next to you? Who\u2019s struggling? Who\u2019s in the trenches with you? Build with them.\u201d There\u2019s so much power in building with our peers.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m so proud to introduce the OBWS Founders Club\u2014a community for ambitious Black entrepreneurs (& aspiring founders) to intentionally connect, share resources, support, and uplift each other. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\n\nIf you\u2019re a Black founder or aspiring founder looking for a supportive network, real connections, and access to resources, this is for you. Learn more and apply through the link in my bio or at founders.obws.com \n\nAnddd if you\u2019d like to partner on events, workshops, provide resources, or anything in between, hit me up! \n\nSee you in the clurb \u270c\ud83c\udffe #OBWSFoundersClub",

After a brief stint in the NBA with the Boston Celtics\u2014winning two championships as a backup to Bill Russell\u2014he transitioned to coaching, taking over Georgetown\u2019s basketball program in 1972.\u2060\n\u2060\nThompson transformed the Hoyas into a powerhouse, mentoring future NBA legends like Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, and Allen Iverson.

Under federal protection, they covered about 12 miles a day and slept in fields and makeshift camps along U.S. Route 80, enduring physical exhaustion and threats to demand equal voting rights for African Americans.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe march followed earlier attempts that were met with violent opposition, notably the events of \"Bloody Sunday\" on March 7, 1965, when peaceful protesters were brutally attacked at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Despite these challenges, the marchers persevered, and their efforts contributed significantly to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark achievement in the Civil Rights Movement. \u270a\ud83c\udffe #BlackHistory\u2060\n\u2060\nFollow @officialblackwallstreet for more Black excellence and Black-owned businesses.",

A strong credit score opens doors to better loan rates and approval. \ud83d\udcb3 STOP #2: Lowering your DTI shows lenders you're financially stable and ready for homeownership. \ud83c\udfe0 Pay down debts and watch your spending habits.\nSTOP #3: Each new account can affect your credit score and debt ratio, making it harder to secure a mortgage. Stay focused on your homeownership goals! \ud83c\udfe1\ud83d\udcb3 \nSTOP #4: Pre-approval from a mortgage lender helps you understand your budget, strengthens your offer and shows sellers (and real estate agents) that you're a serious buyer! \ud83c\udfe1\ud83d\udd11 \nSTOP #5: Plan your monthly budget for the new home, including taxes, utilities, HOA fees, and maintenance costs. \ud83c\udfe0\n\nAnd finally...\n\nSTOP #6: We\u2019ve reached the last step before making an offer and signing the dotted line. As you review house listings, use our Closing Cost estimator to ensure the houses you show your real estate agent are within your budget. Being financially prepared means fewer surprises during the homebuying process. Aim for at least 20% down to avoid extra fees! \ud83c\udfe0\ud83d\udcb0 This concludes our Financial Literacy Month roadmap, but these tips are valid no matter when you\u2019re starting your real estate journey.

The average closing on a house takes 30 to 60 days. Why does it take so long? Many steps go into a closing, including title search and examination, document preparation, loan settlement and more. Title issues, low appraisals and renegotiations can delay your closing. \n\nHave more questions about the closing process?

It remains in the constant fear we have for the lives of Omer Neutra and all of the hostages whose fate and future remain unclear. And it remains in the ongoing war that is taking the lives of our friends and family in Israel, leaving communities in a constant state of danger, causing intolerable and unimaginable suffering throughout the region, and creating deep unease amongst Jews around the world.\u201d\n\nRead more from our Executive Director, David Weinstein, at the link in our bio.",

Someone you never forget.\n\nThe municipality of Ramat Gan commemorates its fallen through paths and streets. Tomorrow, a ceremony will take place to unveil the path named after Yuval.\nYuval fell on October 9th during a pursuit of a cell that had infiltrated Sderot. He was killed in an encounter with another cell that was lying in ambush near Sha\u2019ar HaNegev Junction. In other words, he fought from October 7th amidst the chaos in the surrounding communities to stop it. That\u2019s heroism.\n\nWhen you meet someone like that after the army at a summer camp in the U.S., you don\u2019t know you\u2019re standing before a hero, but the truth is there were signs that he was something special and different.\nYuval was in Garin Atid two or three years after me and we were \u2018Mishlat\u2019 together at Camp Tel Yehuda. Even then, we were impressed by this mature 18-year-old guy who had Amit, the girl he loved, who later became his wife and the mother of his child.\nHe would play music for everyone, a cute and funny scouting specialist . One day, we were assigned to make sure the campers drank enough water during the sports competition (the Maccabiah). Together with two other funny staff members , Plotkin and Monica, we decided to turn it into something else\u2014not just handing out water but getting into characters and creating a water frenzy for the campers. We created a doll that became our symbol, managed to secretly place it on the roof of the Beit ha\u2019am, and caused chaos (it posed a danger to the participants, and they had to bring in a huge ladder to take it down). I am grateful that I got to have days like that with you.\n\nAs for the second gratitude , for leaving your home with Amit in Ramat Gan to go fight the evil terrorists, I don\u2019t even know how to say it.\nThe city of Ramat Gan commemorates you, and the family will participate in the ceremony dedicating a path in your memory in Shaul Park. A path, in a beloved park. You will likely continue to lead people in your path .\nDear Yuval, may your memory be blessed, and thank you.\n@telyehudah",

And then we headed to a new area that was a strip of clubs and restaurants to find a sports bar. Folx in our group wanted to watch one of the American football games happening. \n\nWe found a sports bar, Euphoria, and went inside. We were the only people there. Monday night was a slow night for that strip. \n\nBut the people at the establishment were awesome they hooked up the big television to find the football game they wanted to watch. \n\nWe also found out that they had karaoke on Tuesday nights. So my fabulous Rumi goes to the DJs and convince them to let us karaoke. \ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude1d\n\nSlowly as various people from our party went up to sing different songs, other people from the street came in hearing the music. The DJs kept saying \"tonight isn't really karaoke it's tomorrow night we're doing something special tonight enjoy yourselves!!\"\n\nAND. WE. ALL. DID!!!\n\n#vacation #euphoria #karaoke #delirious #prince #miccheckonetwo",

We always want to take advantage of that, in ways that we can improve upon the protection and the wearability, the way it feels. My consumers always come first, and so if I can improve upon any of those things, I want to do that for the for the customer. That was the motivation and I think we made it better. The goal was to not only increase the protective ability, but also to make it an experience that was enjoyable because sometimes people can dread sunscreens for whatever reason, and that\u2019s changed over the years. We want to make sure that it\u2019s fun to apply, knowing that it is by far the most important thing you can do for your skin.\u2019\u201d\n \nThank you @celiashatzman for sharing our founder, Tiffany Masterson\u2019s, story on creating our new Umbra Mineral Creams.\n \nRead the full feature on @forbes via link in bio.",

The Atlanta location has been a long time coming, and ACS was aware of its pending opening going back to May 2021. The pandemic plans fell through, but the company pushed on and opened its doors in the ATL in late February 2025. The Atlanta location was worth waiting for \u2014 it is For Five\u2019s biggest caf\u00e9 by square footage (3,700 s.f.) across 30+ stores and represents a new flagship in Atlanta and the Southeast.\n\nThe interior features a modern aesthetic and a hotel-like lobby/interior. There is plenty of seating across the bar area, individual, and communal tables. Free Wi-Fi is available, and the coffee shop is open 7AM to 7PM daily. With this new ATL location, For Five is elevating every detail in a caf\u00e9 experience.\n\nAs for coffee: the espresso here is Roc Center Espresso blend from @forfive (a blend of Brazilian, Colombian, and Indonesian coffee beans; tasting notes of lemon zest and cocoa).\n\nA must-order on the coffee menu is the Freddo Cappuccino\u2014get it iced\u2014as that is a rare item to see on a coffee menu in Atlanta. \n\nThe coffee shop also features a full assortment of pastries and a lunch menu\u2014these would be worth exploring over multiple days in Midtown\u2014as well as a popular stuffed cookie \ud83c\udf6a menu (IYKYK). \n\nSwipe through this set to see the ACS Instagram preview of For Five Coffee Atlanta.

SIBO treatment is highly personalized and may need adjustments over time, and having a provider who cares about your whole well-being is crucial to your healing journey. \n\nWe are honored to support and collaborate with those who put so much effort into helping their patients.

The Elemental Diet:  A restrictive diet that replaces food and drinks with liquid or powder formulas that are easy to digest and provide a complete nutritional profile. The formulas break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates into their basic building blocks, such as amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars, and combine them with vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes. Check out @elementaldiet\n\n2. The Low Fermentation Diet: A restrictive diet that aims to help people with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or irritable bowel syndrome. The diet limits fermentable carbohydrates that can feed bacteria. It also includes meal timing guidelines to allow the gut to empty out between meals. Check out @goodlfeofficial @mastprogram \n\n3. The Low FODMAP Diet: A restrictive diet that limits foods that contain fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). FODMAPs are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed by the small intestine and ferment in the colon. Check out @monashfodmap\n\nRemember, always consult your doctor before trying a new diet. Here's to a healthy microbiome! \n\n#WorldMicrobiomeDay #GutHealth #SIBO #IBS #HealthyEating #ElementalDiet #LowFermentationDiet #LowFODMAPDiet",

However, with SIBO, bacteria from the colon migrate and take up residence in the small intestine, leading to an overgrowth. \ud83e\uddeb\ud83d\udd2c\n\nThis overpopulation of bacteria starts feasting on your dietary nutrients before your body can fully digest and absorb them. As the bacteria consume the food passing through, they produce excess gases as a byproduct. It's this gaseous overproduction that leads to the hallmark SIBO symptoms like bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence. \ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude41\n\nWhen bacteria exist in their proper territories and quantities, digestion hums along undisturbed. But when their balance gets disrupted through migration and overgrowth, SIBO's unpleasant digestive woes can take over your daily life.\n\nLearn more on the Trio-Smart Website! \ud83d\udc9c\n\n#TheMoreYouKnow #SIBOInformation #DigestiveIssues #GutHealth #GutBacteria #Microbiome",

In a review conducted at the Mayo Clinic of over 40 research studies, 11% (1 in 9) will develop IBS after food poisoning.\n\nThat means this year in America alone, 5 million people will develop post-infectious IBS! Patients with post-infectious IBS are four times more likely to contract food poisoning again. Additionally, if you do get food poisoning again, it can significantly worsen the symptoms of your post-infectious IBS. \n\nPost-infectious IBS presents itself as IBS-D or IBS-M. Therefore, you might have post-infectious IBS if:\n\ud83d\udca9 You have chronic diarrhea, traveler\u2019s diarrhea, or mixed diarrhea and constipation symptoms.\n\ud83d\ude2b You have abdominal pain and bloating.\n\ud83e\ude78 You have no other serious symptoms like blood in your stool.\n\ud83e\udd2e You have had food poisoning at some point in the past.

My sanity has been kept intact thanks to the Black founders in my circle who remind me that I\u2019m not alone in this journey. We\u2019re all facing similar challenges, and we can navigate them more effectively together.\n\nIssa Rae once said it best, \u201cWe have a tendency to try to network up, but it\u2019s really about networking across. Who\u2019s next to you? Who\u2019s struggling? Who\u2019s in the trenches with you? Build with them.\u201d There\u2019s so much power in building with our peers.\n\nThis is why I\u2019m so proud to introduce the OBWS Founders Club\u2014a community for ambitious Black entrepreneurs (& aspiring founders) to intentionally connect, share resources, support, and uplift each other. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\n\nIf you\u2019re a Black founder or aspiring founder looking for a supportive network, real connections, and access to resources, this is for you. Learn more and apply through the link in my bio or at founders.obws.com \n\nAnddd if you\u2019d like to partner on events, workshops, provide resources, or anything in between, hit me up! \n\nSee you in the clurb \u270c\ud83c\udffe #OBWSFoundersClub",

Under federal protection, they covered about 12 miles a day and slept in fields and makeshift camps along U.S. Route 80, enduring physical exhaustion and threats to demand equal voting rights for African Americans.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe march followed earlier attempts that were met with violent opposition, notably the events of \"Bloody Sunday\" on March 7, 1965, when peaceful protesters were brutally attacked at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Despite these challenges, the marchers persevered, and their efforts contributed significantly to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark achievement in the Civil Rights Movement. \u270a\ud83c\udffe #BlackHistory\u2060\n\u2060\nFollow @officialblackwallstreet for more Black excellence and Black-owned businesses.",

Led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., this march was a defining moment in the Civil Rights Movement, one that helped pave the way for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe road wasn\u2019t easy, but they marched anyway. They marched for justice, for equality, and for the generations that would come after them.\u2060\n\u2060\nToday, we honor their courage and their sacrifice. The fight for our rights didn\u2019t end in 1965, and it\u2019s on us to keep pushing forward. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe #BlackHistory\u2060\n\u2060\nFollow @officialblackwallstreet for more Black excellence and Black-owned businesses.",

Instead, they tend to prefer solitude, deep focus, and meaningful, goal-oriented pursuits over casual interactions. This aligns with the \u201csavanna theory of happiness,\u201d which suggests our brains still respond to social settings shaped by evolutionary history\u2014and that smarter individuals are better equipped to navigate modern environments with fewer social dependencies.\n\nIn essence, it\u2019s not that intelligent people dislike connection\u2014it\u2019s that they seek quality over quantity. For them, peace, purpose, and depth matter more than constant company.\n\n#study #pubity #viral",

The result: new Imax film cameras that are 30% quieter, significantly lighter, and backed by faster scanning and processing for quicker access to dailies. \u201cIf you can solve the problems, I\u2019ll shoot the whole thing in Imax,\u201d Nolan told Imax CEO Rich Gelfond. Now that promise is coming to life.\n\nThe new camera system is currently reserved for The Odyssey, but Imax plans to make the gear available to other directors after Nolan finishes the film. Interest is already surging, with a record number of films in 2025 either using Imax cameras or filming specifically for the format\u2014including Sinners, Mission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning, and Formula One starring Brad Pitt.\n\n#pubity #film",

Almost 70k millionaires for a population of just 3.5 Million!\n\nAnd they very strategically peg their currency to the dollar, thus removing currency volatility altogether!\n\nPeople were expecting Dubai real estate to cool off, but the current economic climate may lead it to continue for another couple of years.\n\n#casarthakahuja",

How did you handle it?\n\nThe biggest red flags in an answer would be if they blame the failure on the team and can\u2019t take ownership... or even if they have no failure story to share, or give non specific vague answers.\n\nSomeone who gives you a weakness that is actually a strength is the biggest bullcrapper on the planet because you want someone who can be real and own up to their genuine shortcomings.\n\nCombine the above with two solid references of people you can speak with and check the above... It could be superiors, peers, but someone of credibility who can validate it.\n\nYou could ask the references to rate the candidate\u2019s trustworthiness on a scale of 1 to 10, and if they give him an 8 or 9, ask why they deducted a point and what would make them worthy of a full 10.\n\n#casarthakahuja",

    "caption": "This one is worth the read \ud83d\udcd6\n\nThe situation : this client came with complaints that her lashes were sore, and she had poor retention. \n\nThe truth : her lashes were glued together, she was not educated on natural lash health and the maintenance or cleansing routine required of extensions. \n\nThe goal : healthy full lashes, 4 week retention, and education on proper home maintenance. \n\n\u2022 first \u2022 I deep cleansed with occusoft platnium to exfoliate the presumed \u2018years\u2019 of dirt oil makeup etc. then set to removing any poorly placed extensions. \n\n\u2022 second \u2022 we did a full set of wispy light extensions for fullness while keeping her natural lash health a top priority. We lashed EVERY SINGLE LASH. Giving her a nice full and guaranteed long lasting retention. \n\n\u2022 third \u2022 we sent this client home with a complimentary bottle of lash cleanser, a cleansing brush, a detailed maintenance plan, and access to our 24/7 customer service line for any issues or questions. \n\n\ud83d\udca0 In 9 years I\u2019ve always believed I could lash over anything, in walks this client. I believe clients like this continue to teach \u2022ME\u2022 how to do better. How to educate more, and how to reverse damage that was done previously. \n\n\ud83d\udca0 I used to not work over another artists work, but what did that do? Impede me from gaining more confidence in my craft, decrease my knowledge for troubleshooting, and hinder me from fostering new friendships. \n\nThe Moral : if you\u2019re unhappy with your lash retention, I\u2019d love to help troubleshoot and get your lashes perfect for you! Most clients go 3-5 weeks between maintenance appointments \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

Fuel practically kept me alive for a week last fall in Colorado. I\u2019d probably still be sleeping under a tarp up there without it. If you\u2019re going hard and long, it really works.\n\nTo try their limited-edition POG Fuel, just go to tim.blog/pog Here\u2019s what that does:\n\n$10 of every Fuel purchase goes to Maui Nui\u2019s Holo \u2019Ai food sharing program, which donates venison to food-insecure families on Maui.

The cashmere and skis are firmly tucked away till next season and our attention shifts to convertible cars, light sweaters wrapped around the shoulders and smart tanned loafers as we migrate towards the Mediterranean. Starting with the annual sojourn @villadestelakecomo then heading south to Monaco to celebrate the legend @alessandroristori.official in full flight at @twigamontecarlo . From there we are at a crossroads but the options are delightful. A left turn will bring us to Portofino and then further south to the Italian riviera and all its glory. A right turn leads us to the French side with stops at Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, Cap d\u2019Antibes and a nightcap in Cannes. The choice is yours. \n\n#summer #monaco #riviera #fineart #annual #travel #mediterranean #tonykellyworld",

The risks are high and the rules were made clear. But lines were drawn to be crossed and this is a season when reality bends to the will of romance and all logic and sensibility disappears. The inspiration for this collection of images initially came from some very entertaining observations I made along the Italian and French rivieras of playful encounters between sharp men in uniform and delightful well heeled female tourists. The handsome Carabinieri, the athletic first officer of the megayacht, the young tanned bellhop and of course the chiseled Napolitan waiter in Capri, these wonderful men are powerless under the spell of an attractive lady dripping in diamonds, drowned in Number 5 and ready for an off side summer romance. The wedding ring is buried in the safe of the Ritz, the husband is still in New York and her hands are free to bring temptation and a whirlwind of drama and lust to her prey. With jobs on the line and concerned lovers asking their whereabouts there is no turning back. Sometimes lust takes the helm and we are powerless to our own course!\n\nWould you take the chance!? Enjoy the summer! \n\n#fineart #yacht #summer #vacations #romance #riviera #mediterranean #tonykellyworld",

My inspiration for this collection was a throwback to the glory days of alpine sports when men wore blazers and ties proudly as they navigated steep glaciers and traversed crevases on some of the most hostile and challenging terrain. Images of handsome bronzed European men in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s blazing down the slopes of St Moritz dressed like they were on the way to a formal dinner has always inspired me. Those who know me well are aware of my love for luxury fabrics and my penchant for the finest of tailoring. This next step in my career has been a wonderful experience and to have had the opportunity to design with the masters of Italian style @kiton has been a dream come true. Travelling to Naples last summer to select the fabrics and work on designs with the Paone family was an experience I will never forget. To see the teams of artisans hand stitching each garment step by step is simply breathtaking. Bravo @kiton . My mission is to bring timeless elegance back to the slopes and we are only starting.

A truly multidimensional artist, the L.A.-based singer/songwriter/filmmaker matches her fiercely honest musical output with self-directed videos, each revealing her singular aesthetic. Zolita now shares \"Ashley,\u201d the second single off of her upcoming EP, Falling Out / Falling In, set to release in February 2023. \u2060\n\u2060\nContinuing with her massively successful and totally self-made approach, \"Ashley\" will be accompanied by a cinematic, self-directed and self-edited music video centering the queer love storyline that is ever present throughout the entirety of the EP. Most famously known for the viral trilogy that she previously released which included \"I F*cking Love you\", \"Somebody I F*cked Once\" & \"Single In September,\" the multi-hyphenate has amassed over 50 million streams, 140 million video views, and 1 million in social audience to date. With looks from legendary sources such as Paper Magazine and Billboard, Zolita will be one to watch as the new year continues!\u2060\n\u2060\nJoin us for some light conversation & makeup \ud83d\ude0d Hope to see you there \ud83d\udc9d\u2728 #QueerieWith #WeAreFluide #MakeupTheRules",

Here are 3 hacks that have improved my performance over the yearsl:\n\n1. Intensity Control \u2026 Not every session should feel like a race. I structure my weeks with purpose, some days are high intensity, others are all about active recovery. \n\nLearning to manage effort has helped me peak at the right time, not burn out.\n\n2. Consistency Over Everything\u2026 Progress doesn\u2019t come from a few epic sessions. It\u2019s the daily grind\u2026 the early mornings, the cold water, the drills on repeat. Show up, even when it\u2019s tough. That\u2019s where the real edge is built.\n\n3. Technique First\u2026 Speed starts with form. I\u2019m constantly refining my stroke, sometimes with video analysis, sometimes with a coach\u2019s eye. Chasing efficiency in the water has been a bigger game-changer than any strength set.\n\nTrain smart. Race hard. Recover harder.\n\n#SwimLife #ProTips #SwimTraining #AthleteMindset #TechniqueMatters",

I fed Mabel and her mom three times per day. They both thanked me before and after every meal. \n\nI saw that Mabel had a kindness to her and knew she could possibly be someone\u2019s indoor kitty one day, so a few weeks ago, I decided to set a trap and she calmly walked right in. \n\nI had no idea how special she was until I spent the last few weeks with her. I will miss her dearly but I know she will be going to a great new home. \n\nThere is a waiting list for her because she is absolutely the dreamiest cat anyone could ever be lucky to share a life with. This will be a contest for who can offer her the best, most loving, safest home. \n\nIf you want a loving, super affectionate lap cat who will also play like crazy and make you laugh; a cat so smart and smushy you will be the envy of all of your friends; a cat who will talk to you when you need a friend, Mabel is your baby. \n\nMabel is approximately 5 months old now. She has already been spayed and she will be fully vaccinated and ready for her new family before Christmas.\n\nMabel would prefer to live by herself or with a male dog or cat. \n\nShe is still very scared of everyday normal things and will need time to decompress. \n\nShe also will 100% run outside and needs to be confined to a room or section of the home for at least a few more weeks. \n\nShe will need to be watched as she is a good hider and a fast runner. She needs to feel safe and wants you to sit with her when she eats. \n\nShe also thanks you for feeding her by kissing you, giving you head butts, and lots of rubs and purrs before she takes a bite. \n\nShe answers to the name, \u201cMama.\u201d \n\nAdoption form here: https://www.northportcatrescue.org/",

For example, inadequate sleep can increase cortisol levels, reduce melatonin production, and lead to insulin resistance\u2014all of which further disrupt your body\u2019s natural sleep-wake cycle.\n\nSupporting your body with plant-powered solutions like Juna\u2019s Nightcap Sleep Gummies can help restore hormonal balance, improve sleep quality, and enhance overall wellness. These gummies are formulated with natural ingredients like Phytomelatonin, Chamomile Extract, GABA, and Passionflower Extract, which work synergistically to calm the mind, reduce stress, and promote deep, restful sleep.\n\n#sleep #wellness #wellnessjourney #healthylifestyle #reels",

You need a healthy bone matrix for strong, young bones, which further determines your bone density and strength.\n\nIf you are on treatments like radiation, chemotherapy or taking medications, birth control pills, hormonal treatments, estrogen blockers then these too deteriorate bone density. Thus as a part of your strategy to manage side-effects, it\u2019s important to supplement or at least focus on food sources that make up your bone matrix. \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\n\t\u2022\tA point I missed - importance of sleep for bone health\u2026 deep restful sleep \ud83d\udca4 is when bones get stronger and processes like bone remodelling and repair occurs.\n\nEven if you have had a knee/hip replacement you still have to take care of your bones.\n\nA quality life as you age doesn\u2019t mean a good bank balance, access to insurance, doctors and other facilities, but also strong and healthy bones.\n\nBuild healthy bones because we will always need them.\n\nDisclaimer: For many medical conditions, you might be required to take calcium supplements. Speak to your doctor about supplements that do not just have calcium but the complete formulation that help build bone matrix.\n\n#BoneHealth #CalciumBalance #VitaminD3 #MagnesiumMatters #HealthyAging #BoneMatrix #LukeCoutinho",

Listed as critically endangered with fewer than 200 of its kind remaining in the wild, the iconic cat is the subject of intense conservation efforts spearheaded by organizations including the Royal Commission for AlUla, the Arabian Leopard Fund, and Catmosphere, founded by HRH Princess Reema Bint Bandar Al Saud (@rosalsaud). From this year on, the animal will also be honored every February 10 by the United Nations General Assembly on the International Day of the Arabian Leopard. In celebration of its new era, the royal pens an exclusive open letter for this month\u2019s cover story. \u201cThe Arabian leopard has become revered in Arabian folklore and tradition, embodying the essence of grace, power, and resilience. Its depiction in art, literature, fashion, and poetry reflects a deep-seated appreciation for its graceful form and elusive nature,\u201d she writes.\nIn a month when fashion goes wild, @yaralnamlah shares our cover with the spotted feline.
