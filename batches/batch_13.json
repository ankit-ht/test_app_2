The crispy, savory bite of this snack was unreal \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd\u2063\n\u2063\nI mixed shredded meat with @omsom Saucy Noodles, shredded potatoes, eggs, and cheese, then air-fried it at 425\u00b0F for 20 minutes.\u2063\n\u2063\nThe result was perfectly crispy bites, and dipping them in chili crisp mayo took them over the top \u2728\u2063\n\u2063\nI loved how the shaved meat weaved into the noodles, making each bite extra delicious. This technique unlocks so many possibilities. Maybe make fried rice with shaved canned meat next? \ud83d\udc40\u2063\n\u2063\nAlso\u2026 what do we call this?! Crispy noodle ball?!

Situations which require \u2018manners\u2019 or \u2018courtesy\u2019 in particular, for example manners around being served food that they don\u2019t like, or introducing yourself to new friends, or not staring when they seem someone who looks different from themselves. \n\nThis flipbook was recommended to me by a friend and it\u2019s now become our dinnertime conversation starter. I flip through it if there\u2019s anything in particular I\u2019m feeling we need to cover, and it provokes great discussions without being directed at any particular child, meaning we cover these topics from a joint place of curiosity rather than from a place of critique. \n\nIt gives a short, sharp, easy to understand explanations that make tricky topics easy to talk about and easy for kids to understand, and has been a really valuable tool to have in our home to help cover grace and courtesy with our young children!\n\n#everydayplayhacks #homeschool #playhacks #preschooltoys #montessoribaby #diymum #babyplayhacks #babysenory #homeschoolmum #sensoryplayideas #homeschoolmom #preschoolplay #preschoolplayideas #playathome #stayathomemum #playathomemummy #montessoriathome #preschoolactivities #preschoolactivitiesathome #toddlermum #montessoritoys #toyideas #playathomeactivities #creativekids #toyideasforkids #montessoripreschool #giftideasforkids #amazontoys #amazonfinds #cooltoys",

It\u2019s not something we slot into every day, it IS every day. It\u2019s not one part of our life, it IS our life. It\u2019s not a neat little box I can tick, it\u2019s a beautiful mess of ideas and experiences, that we come out the other side of having grown and changed and learned things without being able to pinpoint the exact moment that any of it happened. \nThere\u2019s no set of steps, no secret recipe, except letting go of the idea that there\u2019s anything else we \u2018should\u2019 be doing that\u2019s more valuable. There\u2019s nothing more valuable to me than building strong relationships with my kids, and to give them time to build strong relationships with themselves and each other \ud83e\ude77 I hope they remember their childhood with nothing but love, just like I will.\n\nPS.

Make sure your figurine isn\u2019t too small/flat or you won\u2019t be able to see it once the water is in the globe. You can use a plastic block to raise the figurine if needed, by gluing a plastic block/part (such as a bottle cap, mini container etc) to the base and then gluing the figurine on top. We used the clear containers left from the glitter we poured into the snow globes to raise the smaller figures so they could be seen! \n- Fill the globe with water (almost to the top, you need a small amount of space so it shakes up properly) \n- Tip glitter flakes/sparkles into the water, along with a small amount of glycerine (around 1-2 teaspoons, you can add more after if the glitter is falling too quickly, the glycerine slows down the glitter falling to give the \u2018snow\u2019 effect)\n- Screw the lid on so that the figurine is immersed in the water. Tighten.\n- Shake it up and watch the glitter fall like snow! You can add more glitter or glycerine as needed, until you are happy with the result \u2744\ufe0f \n.\nYou can also hot glue the lid on at the end if you wish (I didn\u2019t do this as I wanted to be able to remove the lid to add more glitter if needed)\n.\n.\n\n#everydayplayhacks #homeschool #playhacks #preschooltoys #montessoribaby #diymum #christmasgiftideas #babysenory #homeschoolmum #sensoryplayideas #homeschoolmom #preschoolplay #preschoolplayideas #playathome #stayathomemum #playathomemummy #montessoriathome #preschoolactivities #preschoolactivitiesathome #toddlermum #montessoritoys #toyideas #playathomeactivities #christmasgiftsforkids #toyideasforkids #montessoripreschool #giftideasforkids #kidschristmascraft #christmascraft #cooltoys",

That means your settlement\u2014meant to cover pain, suffering, and recovery\u2014is not something you owe taxes on.\n\n\u2705 No taxes on your justice\n\u2705 No taxes on your healing\n\nYou are being made WHOLE again, not profiting.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the few areas where the law and fairness align.

The 42-year-old also founded social media platform Reddit and has an estimated net worth of $150 million.\n\nSpeaking on this new venture, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve bet big on women\u2019s sports before, and I\u2019m doing it again. I\u2019m honoured for the chance to help this iconic club become every American\u2019s favourite WSL team and much, much more.\u201d\n\nThis move follows an ever-growing trend of big-name investors buying into the women\u2019s game. Natalie Portman co-founded Angel City FC and is one of several high-profile owners heading up the franchise. NFL star Patrick Mahomes co-owns Kansas City Current with his wife, while Michelle Kang\u2019s London City Lionesses have just been promoted to the WSL.",

The players are accused of charges that may include unlawful disclosure of secrets, violation of privacy, and potentially offenses related to the involvement of a minor.\n\nAsencio has publicly addressed the allegations and denies significant involvement in the recording and distribution of the images.\n\nAccording to Asencio, the court order suggests his potential involvement was limited to the \"possible momentary viewing of some images by a third party,\" and it does not attribute to him any participation in their recording or dissemination. He has also stated that he was not the one who sent any intimate images or videos to third parties.",

Then you\u2019re 17 or 18 and you\u2019re making more money than your entire family. Imagine that.\n\nI remember when I broke into the first team, I started spending my money on unnecessary things. The \u00a3600 toiletry bag. The sparkling Louboutins of the time. The Rolex.\n\nThis is what broke my parents. That\u2019s what made them calm me down to talk. I remember what my mother said: \u201cSerge, you know\u2026 it might not be forever. You can\u2019t spend money like that. You have to keep your feet on the ground because everyone falls at some point. \n\nA few weeks after that conversation, everything fell apart. I injured my knee and couldn\u2019t do anything for about 8 months. Time was simply frozen. When I finally returned to the field, I couldn\u2019t join the group. All of a sudden I was on loan to West Brom.\n\nIt was as if my mother had seen the future.\u201d",

How did you handle it?\n\nThe biggest red flags in an answer would be if they blame the failure on the team and can\u2019t take ownership... or even if they have no failure story to share, or give non specific vague answers.\n\nSomeone who gives you a weakness that is actually a strength is the biggest bullcrapper on the planet because you want someone who can be real and own up to their genuine shortcomings.\n\nCombine the above with two solid references of people you can speak with and check the above... It could be superiors, peers, but someone of credibility who can validate it.\n\nYou could ask the references to rate the candidate\u2019s trustworthiness on a scale of 1 to 10, and if they give him an 8 or 9, ask why they deducted a point and what would make them worthy of a full 10.\n\n#casarthakahuja",

Impact grows with empowerment. \n\nThe fundamental mission at @padsplit is to help solve the affordable housing shortage while leveraging housing as a vehicle for financial empowerment.\n\nPadSplit creates a scalable housing solution that aligns incentives between cities that desperately require affordable housing, property owners who seek a return on their investment, and local individuals who need quality housing close to their jobs.\n\nThis unity in incentives is what has led to over 1,000 affordable, all-inclusive housing units in Jacksonville within 18 months of launch. \n\nOn a national level, there have been over 15,000 units created in the last six years. This growth is only projected to accelerate as the need for affordable housing increases. \n\nOne mission. One room at a time. \n\nThank you to @marketingbullmedia and @jaxreia for this photo from November\u2019s monthly meeting.",

By blocking calcium channels and relaxing muscles in the gastrointestinal tract, it eases cramping and discomfort.\n\nWhile peppermint tea offers some benefits, enteric-coated peppermint oil formulations are favored because they are more likely to release directly in the small intestine, providing more effective relief from IBS symptoms. \n\nSome studies suggest peppermint has antibacterial properties that may reduce SIBO bacteria, too!  Peppermint influences serotonin receptors in your gut, which play a crucial role in regulating bowel movements. By affecting these receptors, peppermint may help bring more balance to your digestive system.\n\nPlease note: If you suffer from heartburn or acid reflux, peppermint may worsen your symptoms as it can relax the sphincter between the stomach and esophagus, allowing stomach acids to flow back into the esophagus.\n\nTalk to your provider about incorporating peppermint into your routine for a calmer, happier gut! \ud83d\udc9c\n\nInformation from: The Microbiome Connection\n#IBSRelief #PeppermintPower #DigestiveHealth #NaturalRemedies",

    "caption": "Happy @WorldMicrobiomeDay! \ud83c\udf0e\ud83e\udda0 This year's theme is diet.\n\nHere are three diets often used to manage SIBO and IBS symptoms:\n\n1. The Elemental Diet:  A restrictive diet that replaces food and drinks with liquid or powder formulas that are easy to digest and provide a complete nutritional profile. The formulas break down proteins, fats, and carbohydrates into their basic building blocks, such as amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars, and combine them with vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes. Check out @elementaldiet\n\n2. The Low Fermentation Diet: A restrictive diet that aims to help people with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth or irritable bowel syndrome. The diet limits fermentable carbohydrates that can feed bacteria. It also includes meal timing guidelines to allow the gut to empty out between meals. Check out @goodlfeofficial @mastprogram \n\n3. The Low FODMAP Diet: A restrictive diet that limits foods that contain fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). FODMAPs are short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed by the small intestine and ferment in the colon. Check out @monashfodmap\n\nRemember, always consult your doctor before trying a new diet. Here's to a healthy microbiome! \n\n#WorldMicrobiomeDay #GutHealth #SIBO #IBS #HealthyEating #ElementalDiet #LowFermentationDiet #LowFODMAPDiet",

However, with SIBO, bacteria from the colon migrate and take up residence in the small intestine, leading to an overgrowth. \ud83e\uddeb\ud83d\udd2c\n\nThis overpopulation of bacteria starts feasting on your dietary nutrients before your body can fully digest and absorb them. As the bacteria consume the food passing through, they produce excess gases as a byproduct. It's this gaseous overproduction that leads to the hallmark SIBO symptoms like bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence. \ud83d\udca8\ud83d\ude41\n\nWhen bacteria exist in their proper territories and quantities, digestion hums along undisturbed. But when their balance gets disrupted through migration and overgrowth, SIBO's unpleasant digestive woes can take over your daily life.\n\nLearn more on the Trio-Smart Website! \ud83d\udc9c\n\n#TheMoreYouKnow #SIBOInformation #DigestiveIssues #GutHealth #GutBacteria #Microbiome",

This makes them perfect for boosting information retention, applying knowledge on-the-go, and filling small skill gaps. Macrolearning, on the other hand, lets you deep dive into a subject. Think comprehensive courses or workshops with structured learning, assignments, and assessments. This is ideal for developing complex skills, building a strong knowledge foundation, and even earning certifications. \n\nThe real magic happens when you combine these approaches. They work together to make learning efficient, engaging, and impactful. So, next time you're ready to expand your knowledge, choose the approach that fits your needs, or even use both for a well-rounded learning experience! \n\n#Emeritus #LearningNeverStops #Microlearning #BiteSizedLearning",

When exposed to CDTB, your body forms antibodies against a protein called vinculin. Vinculin is crucial for the nerves in your gut, acting like the wires to a light switch. Without proper connections, your gut doesn't function smoothly. And I've already told you, if the gut doesn't flow correctly, you get a buildup of bacteria, leading to bacterial overgrowth and IBS. That's why IBS responds to antibiotics.\"\n\nOrder IBS-Smart, the only blood test for IBS, to your home today and get on the path to feeling better. \ud83d\udc9c\n\n#GutHealth #IBS #DidYouKnow #HealthAwareness #GutHealing #FeelBetter #IBSTest #DrPimentel #PostInfectiousIBS #Gastroenteritis #FoodPoisoning #IBSSmart",

Under federal protection, they covered about 12 miles a day and slept in fields and makeshift camps along U.S. Route 80, enduring physical exhaustion and threats to demand equal voting rights for African Americans.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe march followed earlier attempts that were met with violent opposition, notably the events of \"Bloody Sunday\" on March 7, 1965, when peaceful protesters were brutally attacked at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Despite these challenges, the marchers persevered, and their efforts contributed significantly to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark achievement in the Civil Rights Movement. \u270a\ud83c\udffe #BlackHistory\u2060\n\u2060\nFollow @officialblackwallstreet for more Black excellence and Black-owned businesses.",

Doing multiple voices and sound effects and then taking stills from iconic pages and creating a very crude but effective animatic (minimalistic animation, motion of whole foreground Images)\nHe would do breakdowns of entire story archive etc. And on occasion would even give small compare and contrast sessions of books vs a recent mcu or dceu movie.\n\nHe Unfortunately passed away this year due to an auto accident and I, among others, know how much power an entire industry is, for losing him.\n\nIf you are In a catagory against him on the ballot in 2024, i am unsure how you would feel okay if even by accident  you managed to take any kind of honor from someone who literally never asked  for someone to honor him just the ones he loved. \nI cannot tell you what to do if you are someone the cbca put on the ballot against him. But if it's me or any one that would be in My general orbit.

    "caption": "\ud83c\udfbc \"Deadly Routine\"\n\n\"Overtime\", the latest release born from the collaboration of two friends and seasoned artists\u2014\"Illogick\" and \"Grim Logick\"\u2014delivers what I consider a true trap hip-hop experience. This track speaks from a place of deep inner pain, connecting directly with its audience.\nThe two verses felt like a journey\u2014one where I traveled alongside the artists. Their impressive flow switches, combined with sharp and emotionally resonant lyrics, created a powerful experience that reminded me what real trap music can sound like.\nOn the instrumental side, the production was built on a minimal yet incredibly catchy melodic structure. I have to say, no one but \"H-L Beatz\" could have created such a dark, creepy atmosphere with this level of finesse. The eerie, almost nightmarish sound elements perfectly complement the lyrical content, never allowing the listener to feel at ease. Meanwhile, the bass and drums hit hard, following an unconventional rhythmic pattern that adds even more punch to the track.\nIf you're like me and constantly on the lookout for something different in trap music, this is one track you absolutely shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Song: \"Overtime\" by Illogick & Grim Logick\n@illlogickysbb @grimlogick\n\nI hope you enjoy listening to this song on Spotify.

When Tara crossed the final finish line at the Bear 100 in Logan, Utah, she became the eighth woman to ever do so, and the first woman to accomplish the feat since 2016 - the same year her mother died of ALS. For Tara, completing the Slam also meant honoring her mother by fundraising for the ALS Association. \n\nIn our latest #HumansofHOKA film, Tara shares her running journey, the process of completing the Slam and how her mother continues to inspire her every step of the way. \n\n\ud83c\udfa5\u2728 Watch the full film by @camp4collective through our link in bio.",

At the 2024 NCAA Outdoor Championships, JaMeesia finished second in the 200-meter final (22.08), breaking Allyson Felix\u2019s North American U20 record in the event. This year, she will be going for gold at the NCAA Outdoor Championships in June. \u200b\n\nIn addition to fast times, JaMeesia makes a statement with her personal style. Looking good helps her feel confident every time she steps on the start line. \u201cI like to be fly when I run,\u201d she says. \u201cMy style is different, and fashion is the way I can show others who I am outside of track.\u201d\u200b\n\u200b\nRead more about JaMeesia and her partnership with HOKA through the link in our profile.\u200b\n\u200b\n#FLYHUMANFLY #HOKA\u200b",

For Jess, race day is the fun part. That\u2019s when her hard work gets put to the test. \n\nBut after spending years climbing the global ranks on the track, Jess\u2019s ability to run at full strength was suddenly taken from her. Last year, the four-time British champion was diagnosed with epilepsy, a brain condition that causes recurring seizures. \n\nThough the diagnosis cut her Olympic year short, Jess was able to receive treatment and ultimately return to the sport with a new perspective. Now, she\u2019s racing with more joy and motivation than ever before. Learn about Jess\u2019s incredible comeback on the blog, available to read at the link in bio. \n\n#FlyHumanFly",

As a pro athlete, it\u2019s definitely much about running fast and performance, but the real competition is primarily within myself. Running has taught me to embrace change, to keep moving forward and to seek growth in every step.\n\nWhat feels really special about joining the Hoka family is that they empower me to feel my authentic self, to embrace both my triumphs and my vulnerabilities, and to share the self-doubt and uncertainty that all of us face. We are all human, we all face the same uncertainties, no matter our achievements or personal stories. I want to send the message that runners of all abilities can relate to the highs, the lows, and everything in between that I experience. I\u2019m also very excited to contribute to the growth of the sport that I love, with a brand that is also making a profound impact on trail running and the trail community at large.\n\nThank you for being part of this journey with me, it means the world.

Remaining consistent with a healthy challenge and checking in with my online community helps me see my goals through. Last year, I felt this way after returning to running after having surgery in the middle of my marathon training season. I wasn't certain how my body would respond to exercise post-hysterectomy. Instead of trying to hammer through all of the miles that I missed while recovering, I adjusted my schedule accordingly. I prioritized moving slowly, steadily, and safely to reach finish lines. After finishing my fall race calendar, I promised myself that I'd dedicate these winter months to building up my foundation and moving like a well-oiled machine. Allow my experience to serve as a testament to stray away from the laundry list of what ifs, listen to your body, remain consistent, and focus on the miles in front of you.\n\n#Bondi9Challenge #HOKA #FlyHumanFly",

I carried a weight in my chest, a numbness I couldn\u2019t quite describe, and an overwhelm of uncertainty \u2013 I knew, for the sake of my overall health, that I needed movement back in my life.\u00a0\n\nI wanted a goal that was big, uncomfortable, and meaningful. A challenge to hold me accountable and reconnect me with running and myself. The NYC Marathon became that goal, @brasforgirlsorg became the \u201cwhy\u201d, and running once again became my safe place to land.\n\nThank you, @hoka, for giving me the platform to share my story and for the support every step (literally!) of the way. \ud83d\udc99 Link in bio to read the full blog!",

The HOKA Flyer loves how the accumulation of miles in hard workouts and long runs leads to progress on the trails. She enjoys the process of a hardfought buildup and how it often translates to a breakthrough on race day. More importantly, Dreama loves the sport for showing her she's capable of doing hard things in running and beyond.\n\nIn Dreama Team, a new documentary film that chronicles the Air Force veteran's ultra running journey, life as a single mom, and pursuit of completing the Western States Endurance Run, Dreama shares the inspiration that drives her to push further. In the years since filming wrapped, the runner from Colorado Springs, Colorado, continues to test her limits in ultra running and even started the nonprofit Dreama Team Way, a program that hosts trail running camps for kids. \n\nLearn more about Dreama's incredible story in the blog, linked in our bio.

    "caption": "Welcome to the HOKA Team, @colinsahlman! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nHeading into the 800-meter race at the Desert Heat Classic in April, Colin Sahlman didn\u2019t know what to expect. The 1500-meter runner from Northern Arizona University was about to race Rivaldo Marshall of Iowa, the reigning NCAA indoor champion, in his first 800 of the season. \n\nThough it was a daunting match-up, some sage advice helped Colin shift his mindset. For the last two years, Colin\u2019s coach Mike Smith has reminded him to focus on competing against other runners, instead of going for a time on the track. In every race, the All-American practices ways to beat as many competitors as he can while trying not to focus on the clock. \u201c[Mike] helped me recognize that racing is more important than running fast, but if you race to win, fast times will eventually come with that,\u201d Colin says. \n\nThe strategy paid off in Tucson, Arizona. For two laps, Colin put himself in a position to win, and ultimately sprinted through the finish line in a 1:45.63 personal best, beating Rivaldo by almost a full second. The victory also set the tone for a breakthrough track season. \ud83d\ude80\n\nColin went on to finish fourth in the 1500 at the NCAA championships and compete through the semifinal at the U.S. Olympic Trials as one of the only collegians in a field of professionals. Looking back, Colin attributes a lot of his success to trusting his ability as a runner, something he hopes more athletes embrace as an important skill. \n\n\u201cView each competition as practice to learn from your competitors and from your own mistakes,\u201d he says. \u201cThe more you practice the better decision you can make in competition later.\u201d \n\nThis fall, Colin is leading NAU into an exciting cross-country season in which the Lumberjacks return as the No. 4-ranked team in the country. On the track, Colin is aiming to win his first NCAA title and compete for a spot on Team USA headed to the 2025 world championships in Tokyo. \ud83d\ude4c\n\nJoin us in welcoming @colinsahlman as he competes for more big wins this season! \n\n\ud83d\udcf8 @nickisabella.photography \n\n#FlyHumanFly #HOKA #TeamHOKA",

And that courage has paid off with a rise she never imagined. \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\n\nThis year, the senior at Northern Arizona University (NAU) lowered her 1500-meter personal best from 4:16 to 4:02 with an incredible leap at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials. On the national stage, Maggi cut almost eight seconds off her previous career best to make the women\u2019s 1500m final. On June 30, she was the only collegian stepping up against the best professional middle-distance runners in the country. \n\nSo, how did the runner from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, who came to NAU with a 4:59 1600-meter PR, make the jump? It all comes down to consistency in training and recovery, she says. \n\n\u201cMy biggest piece of advice for anyone else who is aiming for a breakthrough is just to stick with it through both the good patches and the rough patches and know that if you put 100% in, it may take time, but you will eventually see those results follow,\u201d Maggi says.\n\nNow as part of the HOKA Team, Maggi is leading NAU to an NCAA title chase in cross country. Last year, the women\u2019s team finished second at the NCAA championships. This fall, they\u2019re aiming to top the podium and dethrone three-time champions North Carolina State. \n\nFollow @maggi.congdon\u2019s journey as she chases more breakthroughs on the grass and beyond this year! \ud83d\udca5\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 @clippedinmedia \n\n#FlyHumanFly #HOKA #TeamHOKA",

I love that these shoes can double as a travel shoe as well as one I know I can trust hiking in the rainforest (or anywhere)! \n\nAbout 1.5miles into this hike, the clouds rolled in and graced the day with a downpour. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been testing out a HOKA shoe on a trail and rain made an appearance! But how often can you hike through the rainforest while it\u2019s actually raining? It was stunning, refreshing, and smelled amazing. I had no worries about comfort, traction or support because the Speedgoat 6 made sure every step was steady, supported and cushioned. I really put these shoes through their paces. \n\nI finished 5 miles of hiking, climbed over 1100ft of elevation in both rain and sun, and over varied terrain including wet roots, mud, rocks, dirt, thorny bushes, and leaves. I also found a beautiful flower that represented all the colors on my shoes. Nature IS the inspiration! The Speedgoat 6 really is the GOAT for trail runners and hikers!\n\nTo learn more about the Speedgoat 6, visit the @hoka website (link in bio)!\n\n#HOKAPartner\n#HOKAAdvocate\n#FlyHumanFly",

We are so much more a like than I ever thought. & without YOU & dad I wouldn\u2019t be the man I am today, or accomplish the things I have. I remember when dad would go out of town for work trips, you would go outside and hit me ground balls, and play catch. You\u2019d take me to practice and be at every single game! To think of it, I don\u2019t think you ever missed a single game of mine. That means the world to me. \n-\nNow in my mid 30\u2019s I\u2019m happy to say this is the strongest our bond has ever been, and I want you to know how much I love and appreciate you!\n-\nYou\u2019ve always been the rock of our family. Stoic has always been your presences. You are one of the strongest people I have ever known, and I can say that you are a huge reason why I chose to name my gym @stoik.gyms\n-\nThank you Mom.

And I\u2019ve been to a lot. From the venue, to the content of the speakers, the big and small touches, a VIP dinner @ilovefatox, the wonderful attendees and the overall vibe of money mindset, wealth building and tax and legal strategies, and real life stories, it was amazing. @barbaraschreihans and the whole team @yourtaxcoach absolutely nailed it. We even did a death ceremony with @drbrettjones, to reflect on what is truly important in our lives and our why. Love, love.\n\nI spoke on building generational wealth and legacy through estate planning and loved every second. It was wonderful connecting with so many of the attendees and answering their estate planning questions. @kryslandon and I had an incredible time representing @flourishlawgroup.\n\nI\u2019ve come home motivated and inspired (and with a bit of a cold lol). So what I\u2019m saying is, run don\u2019t walk to Minted Wealth Live 2025.\n\n#legacy #generationalwealth #business #estateplanning #speaker #taxstrategy #getrichwithus #entrepreneur",

Bite-size value content\n\nFocus on reels that give a lot of value, in a short amount of time.\n\nOne of the best ways to stand out to stranger, is to offer clear value, & make a strong impression in a short amount of time.\nDon\u2019t waste people\u2019s time. Keep things short & sweet.\n\nYes, I mean including short reels (5-15 sec.) as a major part of your outreach strategy.\n\nPeople LOVE to save & share: lists, quotes, how-tos, & step-by-step instructions\n\n2. UP-Level your Hook Game\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a strong hook game, people will scroll past your reels.\n\nSo your no.1 priority should be supercharging your hooks with:\n\nCuriosity, interesting visuals, speaking to a very specific person, problem, result or situation & using numbers.\n(You can look at how my hook used these)\n\n\ud83d\udc49Or Comment \u201c57\u201d to get my free Viral Hooks Cheat Sheet\n\n3. Outreach content strategy: Instead of hoping your ideal followers will discover you, make it easy for them.\n\nWhat are the top questions they\u2019re asking? What are they searching for on Insta and in google?\n\nWho are the trending people & what are the trending topics related to your niche that you can talk about to get in front of your ideal audience?\n\nTalk about those things in at least 50% of your content.\n\nThese are a few of the top ways that myself & my students are reaching millions of non-followers each month.\n\n\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\u00a0Comment \u201c57\u201d for my free Viral Hooks Cheat Sheet to boost your views this week!\n\n\ud83d\udc49Share this with someone who needs it!\n\n\u2764\ufe0fFollow @misscarolineflett to grow your audience on Instagram\n\n#instagramgrowth #instagramforbusiness #howtogrowyourinstagram #socialmediastrategy",

These gave me the most reach & brought in the most new followers.\n\nPost frequency: I posted a lot. 2 reels a day. This helped me hone in on the content that worked best on my account.\n\nTopics: I really tried not to guess about what content my audience wanted to see from me. I researched which worked well in my niche & listened to my audience, & made reels about those topics.\n\nReels Formats: I tested a variety of reels formats to figure out which ones worked best for my account. For example, short text on screen reels, & longer reels where I used my voice.\n\nSounds: I used mostly trending audios. I tried to use trending sounds under 10K uses. But the sound that best suited the reel & content message.\n\nEngagement: I asked for engagement whenever & where I could. On screen, in my captions in multiple places, & in my comment section. That includes asking people to follow.\n\n\u2764\ufe0fIf this has been helpful so far, follow for more\n\nEditing: I tried as much as possible to make my reels engaging. I aimed to get my shorter reels \u201crewatched\u201d by using interesting transitions, clips timed with my sounds & looping reels.\n\nRepeat: Whenever I had a top performing reel, I tried to repeat the formula or the topic.\n\nSeries: I also created multiple series about my top performing topics. This made my account more followable.\n\nExpertise & Value: I made my captions longer & full of value to make sure my audience always got something helpful they could take away from my reels.\n\nI hope this helps you!\n\n\ud83d\ude80If you want to learn the exact steps to gaining 50 - 200+ followers a day, like my students, comment \u201cACADEMY\u201d.\n\n(\ud83c\udf891000+ members & counting!)\n\nKeep showing up.\n\n\u2764\ufe0fIf this helped you, Follow @misscarolineflett for more\n\n\ud83d\udc49Save this for later\n\n\u2708\ufe0fShare this with a friend\n\n#instagramhack #instagramgrowth #instagramforbusiness #engagementgrowth #fempreneurs #viralreels",

Follow @vexking for words of wisdom like the ones below! \ud83c\udf1f\u2063\n.\n\u201cWe are not placed on this Earth to endure harm\u2014no matter who it comes from. Love does not ask us to shrink beneath cruelty. Spirituality does not ask us to excuse what wounds and weathers our well-being.\n.\nSometimes, the people closest to us\u2014those we are taught to revere without question\u2014are the very ones who cause the deepest harm. Family ties can be sacred, but they are not a free pass for abuse, manipulation, or emotional neglect.\n.\nPretending someone\u2019s harmful behaviour is acceptable only extends the cycle of suffering. It teaches us to betray ourselves in the name of loyalty.\u2063 You are allowed to draw a sacred line. You are allowed to protect your peace\u2014even if that means creating distance from those who refuse to honour it.\u2063\n.\nCutting ties with a family member is not a failure of love\u2014it is often the greatest act of self-love. It is the soul\u2019s quiet rebellion against patterns that were never meant to be carried forward.\u2063\n.\nBoundaries provide clarity. They are the prayer that says: \u201cI will no longer sacrifice my wellness for someone else\u2019s unwillingness to love me in the way I deserve.\u201d\n.\nIf you need to walk away from continued harm, do it with no regrets. Grieve if you must, heal at your own pace, but know this\u2014you are not wrong for choosing yourself.\u2063\n.\nYou were never meant to suffer endlessly, regardless of whether it\u2019s your \u201cfamily.\u201d You were meant to live, to expand, to embody love\u2014and sometimes, love means letting go.\u2063\u2013#VexKing",

Reaching the big 3-0 this year was a bit unsettling, to be honest! \ud83d\ude05 I didn\u2019t feel entirely ready to leave my 20s behind, but here I am, embracing this new chapter of life \ud83c\udf89\n\n2. \ud83c\udf1f As a BSc Environment Science graduate, I chose not to pursue further studies after seeing my seniors\u2019 job experiences and knowing I didn\u2019t want a traditional 9-to-5 job \ud83e\udee2. At 19, I started @cats.and.bows as a hobby, driven by my passion for crafting! \ud83c\udfa8\u2728 I never had a plan B, but I was determined to succeed, no matter how slow the growth would be. Today, I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019ve built a 7-figure business! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n3. \ud83d\udcbc As a business owner, I\u2019ve learned that I wear multiple hats: artist, marketer, accountant, and more! \ud83c\udfa9 This means working beyond a 40-hour workweek. However, learning to ask for help has been invaluable \ud83e\udd1d.\n\n4. \u2764\ufe0f Initially, I never thought I\u2019d marry before 30, but life had other plans \ud83d\ude43. I met my soulmate, @oye_jatiin and got married at 25. I feel blessed to have him by my side \ud83e\udd70.\n\n5. \ud83d\udc95 Throughout my journey, I\u2019ve realized that friendships may evolve, but true loves stick around \ud83d\udc97. It\u2019s essential to invest your energy in those who reciprocate it.\n\n6. \ud83d\udcaa As a perfectionist in my work and business, I\u2019ve faced challenges, including copycats and doubters \ud83d\ude13. However, I\u2019ve learned that no one can replicate my unique approach.\n\n7. \ud83d\udcc8 I\u2019ve also learned that success isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about impact, freedom, and loving what you do \u2764\ufe0f. Don\u2019t compare yourself to others, especially on social media. Remember, success isn\u2019t measured by likes or followers.\n\n8. \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Establishing boundaries is crucial in business and life. Remember to receive the same respect you give, and don\u2019t hesitate to part ways with clients who don\u2019t align with your values \ud83d\udc4b.\n\n9. \ud83c\udf08 Owning a business can be challenging, but it\u2019s also incredibly rewarding \ud83c\udf1f. Stay confident, consistent, and grateful, and everything will fall into place with divine timing \u23f0!\n\nIf any of this resonates with you, drop a \u2665\ufe0f \u2014l\u2019d love\nto hear your thoughts! \ud83e\udd79\n\n#smallbusinessowner , #handmade #hairaccessories #iamnotashamed #hairbows #bows",

And doubling down on her electrolyte intake, with the higher amount she\u2019s sweating during endurance training.\n\n\u201cThe new training has been a nice change. It\u2019s been challenging, but I really have enjoyed it. Hydration has also been crucial to my recovery, allowing me to show up day after day.\u201d\n\nTia has already qualified in two divisions for the HYROX World Championships this coming June, and broke a record in the Pro Women\u2019s Doubles division last month.\n\nHYROX may be new ground.

The contrast between comradery and competitiveness is what I love so much about it. We can go hard and push ourselves to the limit\u2026 but then we can stop at a cafe and have a latte and a croissant and be best friends.\u201d\n\nAs his training (and competitiveness) ramped up, so did his focus on performance and recovery. After experiencing race-stopping cramps in the Phoenix heat, he realized electrolytes were the missing piece.\n\nLow sodium is probably the biggest driver of muscle cramping during exercise. If sodium lost through sweat isn\u2019t replaced \u2014 and if the athlete over-hydrates with plain water \u2014 fluid balance is disrupted, and cramping is likely.\n\n\u201cI realized that you really need to stay on top of your electrolytes. LMNT has made all the difference. I want to be the friendliest after a ride \u2014 but I train to be un-droppable.\u201d\n\nStay Salty, Ansel \u26a1",

I have been very lucky to have incredible, incredible friends, a supportive family and the best boyfriend and then husband anyone could ask for, BUT I didn\u2019t have a group where I could openly share my struggles, discuss ways to improve my career, life and business and collaborate with others in a way that felt genuine, empowering and exciting.\n\nAnd I think a part of me felt like I needed to earn it on my own, to experience and work through the struggle by myself in order to be truly \u201csuccessful.\u201d Total hogwash.\n\nCommunity just hits different. And let\u2019s face it, sometimes our loved ones don\u2019t always want to hear about or even understand what we go through in certain phases of our life, whether it\u2019s starting law school, building a business or even becoming a new mom. That is where community comes in.\n\nSince I left Biglaw and went off on my own to start @flourishlawgroup and continue to build @wealthylawyersquad , I discovered the true power of community.\n\nThe conversations. The inspiration. And the support to keep going when it feels hard and you feel alone.\nOne of my favorite communities that I have joined is The Daily Drip.\n\nI am forever grateful to this community for the support they provide to me as a modern South Florida businesswoman.\n\nAnd, if you tell me there is a photoshoot involved, you better believe I\u2019ll be there! \n\nWhere are you finding your sense of community? I would love to know!\n\n#southfloridabusinesswoman #community #womeninbusiness #womenowned",

With over 20 years of experience in tax and trusts and estates, my law partner and I take a hands-on and personalized approach to planning for our clients.

Our motto is that \u201cwe help families flourish at all stages of life.\u201d I am also the founder of The Wealthy Lawyer $quad, a community for law students and new lawyers, which provides programming, education and coaching for the law school process and the first years as an attorney, and focuses on developing confidence, healthy mindset, and strong mental wellbeing and creating a dream career and wealth.

I am also the host of The Wealthy Lawyer $quad Podcast, where our mission is to provide content that inspires, empowers and supports law students and new lawyers who want to dream big and I strive to shake up the status quo of what it means to be a successful lawyer in today\u2019s world.

A story of evolution, and the freedom that comes with living on your own terms.\n\nIn partnership with @spinellikilcollin & @bredastudio \n\nPhotography by @filmawi\nStyling by @carahayward\nCreative Direction @mayumiphipps\nMake Up by @mata_marielle \nHair by @tarikbennafla \nInterview by @ambaroserhianna\nExecutive Produced by @merdeagency \nBTS Video by @nakaashhu \nVideo Edit by @slinkpost \n\nWatch the full interview on the @GAFFER YouTube channel \u2014 link in bio.\n\nPowered by @komihq\n\n#EVAGUTOWSKI\n#The100",

A lot of you might remember back in the day when i was really into skateboarding and surfing. Board sports made me SO HAPPY, it challenged me in a way that i craved and it was the one hobby i had in my life that made the whole world seem to fade away while i was doing it. But then i got in a bad car accident, i was rear ended by a huge ass truck on the freeway and ended up having to get 3 spine surgeries and 7 other minor surgeries over the years of 2019-2021. I had to completely quit action sports and dancing, and for years, i felt like a big part of my identity was lost and out of my control. \nWhen i met Olav, he introduced me into snowboarding and it was the first thing i got to try when i finally recovered from years of depression, and all of the pain and the surgeries. It gave me that feeling of challenge, that feeling of \u201ci can be strong\u201d again, and the childlike joy that board sports had given me since i was a just a kid with a Walmart skateboard pushing around Orange County lmao. Snowboarding has given me such amazing friends, taken me to places i never thought I\u2019d go, and given me my confidence back. I can\u2019t tell you enough how much i enjoy this. Thanks @swatch @thenines.cc for letting me a fly on the wall to this insane world you\u2019ve created, and thank YOU SNOWBOARDINGGGG \u2764\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc2\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f",
