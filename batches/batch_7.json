But what most people don\u2019t realise is that the majority of the products being sold to you are just expensive mixes of sugar, sweeteners and salt with clever marketing \u2013 exactly the kind of added ingredients that many of us are trying to reduce.\n\nCheck the video for a typical electrolyte drink recipe - high sugar, high salt \ud83d\udc46\n\nThat\u2019s not to say they don\u2019t have a role. If you have diarrhoea or vomiting, a high stoma output, are sweating excessively in a hot climate, or are exercising at an intense level for more than an hour (dripping in sweat the whole time), then sure. Electrolyte drinks can be a handy tool to restore and maintain body salts, which helps to maximise fluid absorption from your gut, amongst many other functions. But for the average person looking to stay hydrated day-to-day? There\u2019s no magic here.

If it\u2019s dark and strong smelling, it\u2019s a sign that you need to drink more water. You should aim to get to a pale colour that\u2019s odourless (unless you\u2019ve eaten asparagus, that is). \n\ud83d\udca7 Instead of reaching for an electrolyte drink to support hydration, try adding some of your favourite fruits and veggies to your water bottle - like cucumber, berries, mint or basil - to encourage you to sip on it more frequently throughout the day.\n\nLet me know in the comments if there\u2019s another health trend you want me to tackle\ud83d\udc47\n\nFor the science lovers \ud83d\udd0d\nPMID: 35839362",

It\u2019s known as the thermogenic effect of food. But here\u2019s the key, the type of food you eat matters. \n\nWhole foods like fruits, nuts, and wholegrains make your body work harder, burning more energy in the process. But when it comes to ultra-processed foods (UPFs), it\u2019s a different story. Machines have done most of the work for you, so your body burns fewer calories digesting them, as much as 50% less compared to whole foods. \n\nThis is just one of many examples of why calorie fixation is flawed, not to meantion how it ignores the full picture of health. It also explains why the research shows that any \u201cresults\u201d you might see are often short lived. \n\nIf your New Year goal is reaching your happy weight (not forgetting your wider health goals), here are 3 things I\u2019d recommend \ud83d\udc47\n\ud83c\udf4e Make the switch from UPF to whole foods where possible. Not only will this keep you more satiated, but your body uses more energy in the digestion process. \n\ud83c\udf4e Meal timings has been shown to affect your hunger cues, so start by bringing your dinner time forward by 1 hour.\n\ud83c\udf4e Keep the skin on your foods (like your kiwi fruit, sweet potatoes etc) as this contains extra fibre which helps to stimulate the release of the appetite regulating GLP-1 hormone. \n\nFeel free to share this \u2b50\ufe0f\n\nFor the science lovers \ud83d\udd0d\nPMID: 20613890 \nPMID: 17469900 \nPMID: 36198293",

Stepping away from producing my own collections has opened up a new world of exploration into my personal relationship with clothes, fashion, and acquiring new things. \n\nWhile it was incredible to create what I wanted to wear season after season, I\u2019ve recently been enjoying the freedom of discovering the visions of others, especially those whose values align with mine. I\u2019m especially grateful for my dear friend @vanessaanabarboni , founder of @anothertomorrow . Their commitment to sustainability and ethical practices is the real deal as are their beautiful and timeless designs. There\u2019s nothing easy about running a brand built on the ethos of doing the least harm while also trying to improve and create new systems of repair and care within a broken industry.\n\nVisiting her stunning new flagship store in SoHo reminded me why I love clothes\u2014the joy they bring, especially when made with integrity and respect for our planet.\n\nAt the end of the day, do I really need anything new? Probably not. But I still find immense joy in expressing myself through fashion and appreciate exquisite craftsmanship that\u2019s done with care. Another Tomorrow is a brand that I believe is paving the way for a more conscious future in fashion. I\u2019m excited to support their mission and have a ton of respect for the people in this industry who are doing the good work. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nAnd seriously, how hot is this suit??? \ud83d\udd25",

Thank you, Natalie, for allowing me to be a part of your real estate journey. Wishing you all the best in your new home and adventures ahead! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nI also cannot thank my team enough for helping me see this to the end. @homewithcollhadd, @movewith_miller & @nana_rhymeswithdana were my knights in shining armor as I dealt with personal issues leading up to closing.

So many of us had the opportunity to speak with James, listening to him describe all the work that they do. They are community-driven, and provide peer support programs empowering vets and first responders by offering a safe and supportive environment where they can connect with others who have shared experiences. \n\n\u2665Thanks to all the attendees and online donations, we were able to raise over $1,100 for @ProjectRefit which was matched by mcfa (@bj_kraemer) for a \u1d1b\u1d0f\u1d1b\u1d00\u029f \u1d0f\ua730 $2,225!\n\n\ud83e\udef6Huge thank you to @merakimarket_nj & @ShopJacksonProper for hosting such an incredible evening. \n\n\ud83e\udd43Thank you to @MJTmortgage at Guaranteed Rate for serving up the tequila & knowledge!

It is TOUGH out here for buyers. After going through everything step by step, I let him know the reality of winning your first offer, or even your second and third, is slim.\n\nWell don\u2019t you know, Zac goes and proves me wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve never been happier to be wrong in my life.\n\nZac and I went and looked at [T H R E E] houses and we put in [O N E] offer. I\u2019ll be honest, Zac knew what he wanted and wasn\u2019t afraid to fight for it. His offer was very aggressive and when it came down for all the best offers to be submitted, he stayed firm with his original terms\u2026 and won!! \ud83c\udf89 This is the perfect example of price not being the only important factor. There were offers slightly higher, but our terms were \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffc.\n\nSo, here\u2019s to Zac, with the most seamless transaction since I started in real estate \ud83e\udd42!!! I\u2019m so happy for you.\n\n#thecolleenhaddengroup #southjerseyrealtor #southjerseyrealestate #cinnaminson #compass",

After an immediate medical check-up, he was airlifted to the Ha\u2019il hospital where his CT scan came out clear and revealed no major injuries. Ross has been discharged from the hospital and has joined the team tonight. \n\nBranch had been delivering a stellar performance right since the start of the rally, holding 4th place overall until his untimely exit. The 2024 World Rally-Raid Champion and last year's Dakar Rally runner-up will now shift his focus to recovery and is determined to come back stronger for the next race of the World Championship. \n\nCornejo will now be leading the charge for the team, carrying the mantle forward in the rally and has his sights set on getting a respectable Dakar finish for the team this year. \n\nToday\u2019s Stage 6 of the rally presented a unique challenge, spanning 605 km and divided into two segments. A 171 km untimed road section, classified as a \"transfer,\" separated the two parts, resulting in 434 km of timed competition. \n\nTomorrow\u2019s Stage 7 with 455 km of timed specials will make the rally more challenging with a good mix of fast and slow terrains, difficult navigation and a touch of mountain racing as well. Tomorrow\u2019s stage will start slightly later to allow enough time for the helicopters to reach their respective positions after their multiple deployments for race safety today.\n\n@rossbranchbw @buhler210 @nachocornejo11 @dakarrally @officialw2rc @heromotocorp @monsterenergy @alpinestars\n\n#ChargeOfChampions #RaceTheLimits\n\n#Dakar2025 #Dakar #DakarRally #HeroMotoSports #dakarrally2025 #racing #rallyracing #motorsport #motosport #heromotosports #offroading #offroadracing #racinglife #rallylife #xpulse",

Ross finished 4th, making a strong comeback after yesterday's navigation error.\n\nWith the completion of Stage 5, Branch has maintained his 3rd position in the overall standings, while Cornejo holds steady at 9th. Both riders remain firmly in the top-10 overall standings. As the team reaches the rest day, Cornejo and Branch are filled with confidence and motivation.\n\nThe team is now geared up for the second week of the Dakar Rally, which promises to be tougher with longer stages. The Stage 6 will feature 605 km of timed specials, including treacherous sandy terrain, hills, dunes, and sandy tracks.\n\n@rossbranchbw @buhler210 @nachocornejo11 @dakarrally @officialw2rc @heromotocorp @monsterenergy @alpinestars\n\n#ChargeOfChampions #RaceTheLimits\n\n#Dakar2025 #Dakar #DakarRally #HeroMotoSports #dakarrally2025 #racing #rallyracing #motorsport #motosport #heromotosports #offroading #offroadracing #racinglife #rallylife #xpulse #xpulse200",

Michael\u2019s boundless enthusiasm and lack of self-awareness set the stage, while Jim\u2019s deadpan sarcasm keeps it grounded\u2014until Dwight, with his unrelenting intensity and bizarre logic, blows it all out of proportion. Together, they\u2019re an unstoppable force of cringe-worthy comedy and unexpected teamwork. Whether it\u2019s Jim teaming up with Michael to outmaneuver Dwight or all three uniting for a shared goal (usually involving some absurd office mission), their dynamic is as unpredictable as it is hilarious. Michael\u2019s misguided attempts to be the \u201cworld\u2019s best boss\u201d often turn into a circus, with Dwight acting as his loyal enforcer and Jim subtly steering things in a less disastrous direction. And yet, when they manage to align their chaotic energy, the results are oddly effective, like the time they band together to land a big client or pull off a ridiculous party. Their chemistry thrives in the tension between Jim\u2019s cool detachment, Dwight\u2019s obsessive dedication, and Michael\u2019s over-the-top antics.

His sarcastic remarks and unapologetic laziness made him the perfect counterbalance to Greg\u2019s awkward attempts at being liked. Rodrick wasn\u2019t just a typical annoying older brother; he had a unique charm that made every scene he was in unforgettable. His rock band dreams and over-the-top antics gave the movies a much-needed dose of rebellious fun, keeping things from getting too predictable. Despite his constant pranks and teasing, moments of unexpected vulnerability showed there was more to him than just mischief, making his character surprisingly relatable. He brought energy and humor that often outshined even the main plot, making viewers root for him in his own chaotic way. From his iconic \u201cRodrick Rules\u201d moments to his hilarious one-liners, he left an imprint on the series that no other character could replicate. Without Rodrick, the movies would have been entertaining, but with him, they became something unforgettable and genuinely fun to watch.\n-\n#memes #memories #reels #explore #comedy #funny #lol",

You remember that one song she posted on her Instagram story 43 weeks ago, and you queue it up, hoping it\u2019ll subtly impress her. When it starts playing, you glance at her face, pretending it\u2019s just a random pick, but secretly hoping she notices. Her eyes light up, and she asks how you know that song, her voice a mix of curiosity and surprise. You shrug casually, trying not to give away the hours you spent scrolling through her profile, and say, \u201cI just thought you might like it.\u201d The moment feels small but meaningful, as if you\u2019ve cracked a secret code that sets you apart.

Gambit, a beloved character from the X-Men universe, is known for his Cajun charm, street-smart attitude, and unique ability to kinetically charge objects, often throwing explosive playing cards. Tatum\u2019s casting felt like a natural fit, as he embodied both the physicality and charisma that make Gambit such a standout hero. His Southern roots and effortless swagger would have lent authenticity to Gambit\u2019s iconic personality. Fans were excited to see how he might bring the character\u2019s humor and rogue-like qualities to life, balancing the edge and charm that define him. The scrapped project left many wondering how Tatum might have handled the action sequences, which would undoubtedly showcase Gambit\u2019s agility and combat skills. Even without the film, the idea of Tatum as Gambit remains a fascinating \u201cwhat could have been\u201d in superhero cinema. It\u2019s a testament to Gambit\u2019s popularity and Tatum\u2019s star power that the character is still eagerly awaited by fans of the X-Men franchise.\n-\n#channingtatum #memes #reels #explore #gambit #lol #comedy #funny",

From Scooby\u2019s over-the-top antics to Shaggy\u2019s hilarious one-liners, the humor keeps you laughing while staying true to the original cartoon\u2019s charm. The movie doesn\u2019t shy away from poking fun at its own tropes, like Fred\u2019s vanity, Daphne\u2019s dramatic flair, or Velma\u2019s overly analytical mind. Watching the gang navigate absurd mysteries with their usual quirky chemistry is both entertaining and endearing. The physical comedy, especially with Scooby and Shaggy, is a standout, with food fights, wild chases, and clumsy heroics taking center stage. Even the villains add to the humor with their exaggerated schemes and comical motivations. The movie layers in jokes for both kids and adults, creating a balance that makes it enjoyable for everyone. Ultimately, the humor captures the essence of Scooby-Doo while adding a fresh, playful spin for the live-action format.\n-\n#comedy #funny #memories #lol #explore #funnyvideos #reels #memes",

The humor is lighthearted and silly, making them the kind of films you can watch over and over without getting tired of the jokes. They capture the nostalgic warmth of reconnecting with people from your past, reminding you of the joy and chaos of close friendships. The ensemble cast brings so much chemistry that it feels like they\u2019re genuinely having fun, which makes the experience even more enjoyable for the audience. The movies balance laughter with heartfelt moments, showing that life\u2019s best memories often come from the simplest times spent with loved ones. The laid-back settings, like lakeside cabins and family cookouts, create a vibe that feels cozy and relatable. Even when the humor gets over-the-top, it\u2019s never mean-spirited, which makes them easy to watch when you just want to relax. Ultimately, the Grown Ups movies are about cherishing the people who make life fun, making them a go-to for comfort and feel-good laughs.\n-\n#adamsandler #comedy #comfort #friends #explore #reels #comedy #lol",

During the show, they presented a humorous \u201cdeleted scene\u201d featuring Holland\u2019s character, Peter Parker, visiting a dry cleaner named Joe, portrayed by Kimmel, to pick up his Spider-Man suit. In the skit, Peter awkwardly explains that the suit is his pajamas, leading to a comedic exchange where Joe remains oblivious to Peter\u2019s true identity. The scene plays on the classic superhero trope of maintaining a secret identity, with Kimmel\u2019s character humorously failing to connect the dots despite obvious clues. This playful interaction delighted fans, showcasing Holland\u2019s charm and Kimmel\u2019s comedic timing. The skit added a lighthearted touch to the film\u2019s promotion, emphasizing the relatable aspects of Peter Parker\u2019s double life. It also highlighted the everyday challenges superheroes might face, such as mundane errands like picking up dry cleaning. Overall, the segment was a memorable and entertaining addition to the promotional campaign for the film.\n-\n#spiderman #tomholland #memes #reels #explore #comedy #jokes #lol",

The encounter was brief, barely more than a flicker in time, but within the swirling clouds of dust, there was something vast, an ancient knowing exchanged between them. In the space between their eyes, between each calculated breath, a quiet understanding passed\u2014wordless, elemental, older than the tundra itself. What seemed like a fleeting test of strength held the weight of millennia, carried in every particle of dust that hovered in the still air.\n\nThe dance between predator and prey is an ancient, primal rhythm, a choreography etched into the bones of the earth. For millions of years, this exchange has unfolded, each step imbued with a quiet inevitability\u2014the survival of one relies on the death of the other. But the predator does not simply hunt; it seeks to claim its place, to assert itself in the ongoing story of life. The prey calls upon a trembling strength, a resistance as old as the hunt itself, each sinew taut with purpose. In this timeless ritual, neither truly leads or follows. There is only the enduring balance, the unspoken understanding that both are bound by something larger than hunger or fear. \n\nRead more about the lives of wolves at the link in bio.",

Such behavior may label moles as a backyard nuisance, but they actually play a beneficial role in soil management and controlling the population of undesirable grubs and insects. By digging and moving earth, moles permit better aeration of the soil and enable organic matter to travel deeper down. Their tunneling also allows subsoil material to be moved closer to the surface, where nutrients may be more available to plant roots.

In Zambia, climate change is forcing humans and wildlife to compete for the same resources, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense\u2014but despite this adversarial relationship, there was still a sense of awe among bystanders, many of whom had never seen an elephant so close. \n\n\ud83d\udcf8 2 - Ryan Tidman (@ryantidman) photographed Pacific herring spawning off the coast of Vancouver Island. Every spring, females release up to 20,000 eggs each, and then males release milt (semen)\u2014an event that offers both a visual spectacle and a valuable food source for animals like this nearby sea lion.\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 3 - Peter Fisher (@pet__fish) captured an image of a volcanic eruption in Guatemala. Fuego Volcano erupts multiple times a day\u2014and a hike up its dormant neighbor, Acatenango, offers visitors a front-row seat to this remarkable phenomenon.",

PadSplit units typically rent for $600-800 per month on average, including utilities, far less than others in co-living.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3\ud83d\udcbc PadSplit is an asset-light, sustainable business model\n\nMany of the coliving companies that failed appeared to take on too much financial risk and overhead through excessive leasing of properties or expensive build-outs. By contrast, we\u2019ve taken an asset-light approach by aligning incentives with property owners.\n\nRenting by the room is and always has been a more profitable business than renting entire houses or apartments. But it\u2019s also a lot more work. PadSplit was created to provide the services and technology that most housing providers either cannot provide on their own or simply don\u2019t want to deal with.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3\ud83e\udd1d A resilient team and company culture\n\nA successful business is about more than just numbers and models - it\u2019s about the people behind it. Our mission to \u201csolve the affordable housing crisis while leveraging housing as a vehicle for financial empowerment\u201d has played an enormous role in our ability to attract and retain outstanding talent.\n\nWe\u2019re incredibly privileged to work alongside some amazing people who likely wouldn\u2019t be here if they weren\u2019t confident in our mission. Seeing and hearing the intensely personal stories of transformation through housing inspires us all.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3\ud83d\ude80 Major plans to scale\n\nWe have major expansion plans in the pipeline, with new markets we\u2019ll be entering and new products we\u2019ll be rolling out. We\u2019re also investing heavily in technology to streamline operations and provide even better service to our residents and partners.\n\nWe hope other coliving companies enter the market, even if they are directly competitive with us because we are a social impact-focused company. We believe we need more smart people in this space to attack the many issues and rise all tides.\n\n#coliving #padsplit",

It\u2019s a nice place to be that both provides more income and diversification of income in case I lose my job!\n\nHow do I do this?! Basically I have a lot of money invested. About $3 million sitting in index funds right now. Index funds are paying about a 2% annual dividend at the moment. 2% of $3M = $60K/year of free money.\n\nHow did I get to $3M invested?! A large part of it came from when I was fortunate enough to sell a company I started in college. That provided a windfall of about $2M. That $2M has since grown to over $5M (the rest of that money in my house and some other investments).\n\nIt\u2019s easy to write this off as \u201coh, he just sold a company\u201d. That\u2019s partially true for sure, but before, during, and after selling the company I was also doing some important personal finance things. Specifically, I was living below my means and investing early and often. If at the age of 34 when I sold my company, I decided to start living like a baller in Southern California, I\u2019m quite sure I could have spent through that $2M by now. Instead, I decided to put that money to WORK to provide income for the rest of my life!\n\nDividends are obviously great because they represent cash deposits into your account without having to sell any shares! But should you CHASE dividends? i.e. should you be buying stocks or funds that produce high dividends to get MORE of them? In my opinion: No. Buying stuff that produces more dividends is just asking for more of your growth to be immediately taxable to you and you\u2019re likely omitting more quickly growing companies. For example last year, Vanguard\u2019s dividend ETF (VYM) had total growth of about 17% compared to their growth ETF (VGT) which had total growth of about 29%. I don\u2019t buy VGT either... I buy BOTH in a total market fund, like VTI!\n\nIf you want to learn this stuff, my investing course is having a HUGE SALE that ends Sunday!

They all do the same thing and that\u2019s the point. They follow the index they\u2019re assigned to. And all the little details just don\u2019t matter that much.\u200e\n\u200e\nThe twelve index fund listed here are kind of a mixed bag: \u200e\n\u200e\n\u2022 7 are mutual funds, 5 are ETFs. \u200e\n\u2022 7 follow 500 of the biggest stocks. 1 follows 1,000 stocks. Four follow the total stock market (~4,000 stocks)\u200e\n\u2022 They\u2019re offered by a bunch of different companies (Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, iShares/Blackrock, State Street)\u200e\n\u2022 Their expense ratios range from 0.015% (FXAIX and FSKAX) to 0.14% (VFINX). \u200e\n\u200e\nWith all those differences, they all essentially do the same thing. Own a bunch of US stock. EVEN the fact that some follow 4,000+ stocks vs others follow only 500 doesn\u2019t make a big difference (for those asking me S&P 500 vs total market).\u200e\n\u200e\nWith all those differences, and after over 13 years of tracking them the top performing index fund outperformed the lowest performing one by growing the $10,000 to $60,686 versus $57,668. Not a big deal.\u200e\n\u200e\nIt turns out the S&P 500 index funds all outperformed the total market index funds by about 4% over this time. That doesn\u2019t mean that trend will continue in the future (I actually expect it won\u2019t), rather I think it reflects that large companies fared slightly better than small ones during the pandemic and AI tech boom.\u200e\n\u200e\nAnd if you want to know which one actually performed the best. Drumroll\u2026 It was, surprise surprise, the one with the lowest expense ratio (0.015%): FXAIX (Fidelity 500 Index Fund).\u200e\n\u200e\nThe moral of the story is don\u2019t get caught up in the weeds. Don\u2019t worry about which exact index fund to buy, just pick one with a low expense ratio and spend your effort plowing more money into it.\u200e\n\np.s. Our huge 2025 launch sales is ON!

    "caption": "This is an annual recurring event on my actual calendar. These are the few financial things I make sure to take care of at the beginning of each year. To break them down:\n\n \u2022 I\u2019m almost always over the Roth IRA income limit, so I do a \u201cbackdoor\u201d Roth IRA which consists of contributing to a Traditional IRA, then converting it to a Roth IRA. The max you can contribute to an IRA in 2025 is $7,000. (I have a video on Backdoor Roth IRAs in my course and an article on my website).\n \u2022 HSAs have the best tax advantage of any account! Money goes in tax-free, investments grow tax-free, and money spent on qualified medical expenses is tax-free! I keep mine with Fidelity. I keep about $2K in cash to cover current medical expenses, the rest I invest in a target date index fund.\n\u2022 Keep in mind putting money in an IRA or HSA alone doesn\u2019t do anything. You have to take the second step and invest that money! I invest mine in index funds.\n\u2022 My dead box is a Google Drive folder with a list of accounts and instructions to help unwind my financial life in the unlikely event of my untimely demise. I go through and update this every January. It\u2019s amazing what changes over a year!\n\u2022 The dead box is no good if no one knows where to find it, so I email my wife and brother (will executors) to remind them it\u2019s there and how to get to it.\n\u2022 They say that \u201cnumbers that are tracked improve\u201d. I\u2019ve been tracking my net worth since I was 20 when it was about $5,000. It dropped to -$5,000 by age 22, but today it\u2019s about $5.3 Million.\n\nMy Roth IRA is currently worth about $147K and my HSA has $35K. That amount plus the annual contributions invested at an 8% rate of return will be worth over $2.1M in 25 years!\n\nIf you want to learn more about this stuff, both my money courses are officially on sale TODAY along with the huge relaunch of the 2025 investing course! Check my \ud83d\udd17 in bio!\n\np.s. Anyone who buys either course or a gift course this week also gets a $20 gift card to the PFC store! Treat yo\u2019 self to a t-shirt! :)\n\nAs always, reminding you to build wealth by following the two PFC rules: 1.) Live below your means and 2.)

If you\u2019re ready to get serious about investing for your future, check out my link in bio!\n\nI was inspired to make this post when I was thinking about those little \u201cinvestment amount\u201d sliders that you often see as part of the 401(k) enrollment process for new hires. You can just slide them back and forth to decide what percent of your income you want to put into your 401(k).\u200e\n\u200e\nI can picture the tens of thousands of young workers who are confronted with this slider daily. I imagine they look at it kind of confused, wondering what this 401k deal is and why they have to make this choice and also what\u2019s for lunch. \u200e\n\u200e\nBut what they don\u2019t realize is that sliding that little dial over to the right will buy them YEARS of their freedom in the future. In that moment they\u2019re making the decision between a little extra spending now or potentially decades of their life back in the future.\u200e\n\u200e\nYou have this choice too!

And when I got back from the optometrist, I charged back here to remind you that this kind of stuff is NOT REAL. \n\nInvesting is NOT picking the next hot stock and getting rich quick. That's gambling. And it works out about as well as going to Vegas. Sometimes you win over the short term, but over the long term you'll lose. And those who are putting these headlines up seriously are just highlighting their few wins without ever being held accountable for an actual audit of how they actually perform compared to a stock market index.\n\nWhat IS investing then? It's slowly acquiring more and more shares over time. Market up? Buy more. Market down? Buy more. Dividends paid out? Reinvest to buy more. Which stocks? Buy them all. THIS is the strategy that, over time, turns into rampant exponential growth. This is how rich people get rich.\n\nWe should have all learned how to do this in high school, but most of us didn't. That's why I do what I do. If you want to learn how to invest FOR REAL my comprehensive index fund course is ON SALE but the sale ends tomorrow (Sunday 1/19). Over 20,000 have taken it with an average review score of 4.96. If you take the course and don't like it, let me know and I'll give you your money back.

    "caption": "It\u2019s important to note that what Brittany (and Tiffany!) did is totally impossible. NOBODY knows when the top or bottom of the market will be. When the market drops 20%, no one knows in the moment if that\u2019s the bottom and it\u2019s about to shoot back up, or we\u2019re just started on a 50% decline. No one knows.\n\nYET STILL, even though Brittany had IMPOSSIBLY PERFECT timing, she still lost to Sarah. That tells an important lesson. EVEN IF YOU GET THE TIMING RIGHT, while you\u2019re sitting on the sidelines waiting to \u201cbuy the dip\u201d the early and often investor will be building a lead you\u2019ll never overcome. \n\nThere\u2019s an even more important lesson here: ALL THREE OF THESE INVESTORS ARE RICH. Even \u201cterrible\u201d Tiffany is a multi-millionaire! Why? Because once she got in the market she practiced BUY AND HOLD investing. She bought, held, and let the market do its work for decades. So even though she had IMPOSSIBLY BAD timing, the very simple practice of buy and hold made her rich.\n\nYou can do the same! Set up some auto-contributions to your Roth IRA, 401k, or brokerage account, and have your money auto-invested into an index fund. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what these three did to turn a few hundred bucks a month into millions.\n\nIf you AREN\u2019T doing this yet, PLEASE COME LEARN WITH ME. I lay all this out A-Z in my index fund course that\u2019s on sale just until midnight tonight (Sunday 1/19). The course is just $69 until midnight. It\u2019s videos, quizzes, and projects taken at your own pace. You get unlimited lifetime access including all future updates! If you don\u2019t love it, let me know and I\u2019ll give you your money back!\n\np.s. Everyone who signs up for a course before midnight also gets a $20 gift card to the PFC shop (get yo\u2019 self a t-shirt or mug) and if you\u2019re enrolled in both courses (Only $119 until midnight) you can attend semi-private office hours with ME to get your questions answered!\n\nAs always, reminding you to build wealth by following the two PFC rules: 1.) Live below your means and 2.) Invest early and often.\n\n-Jeremy\n\n#stockmarket #learntoinvest #markettiming",

    "caption": "Sometimes investing can be so abstract when you\u2019re looking at charts and talking theory, so I figured I\u2019d just show you what stupid buttons to click on. It\u2019s really easy. It takes about five minutes. WHY we do it this way (Roth IRA, target date index fund, buy and hold, stay the course, etc) is a longer explanation, but if you\u2019re new to investing, at least we can demystify what it actually looks like to invest.\n\nIt\u2019s really as easy as shown in this post. If you\u2019re someone who has NEVER INVESTED before, I highly recommend doing this. Fidelity and the funds listed here have $0 minimums. Go open an account and throw in 50 bucks. That simple exercise can help eliminate the \u201cstatic friction\u201d keeping so many people from getting started. The fear of the unknown or worry about getting it wrong keeps so many people on the sidelines. Go give it a try with just a little bit of money and watch it while you keep learning more.\n\nThe buttons to click are really easy. I show you them here. BUT I read ALL THE TIME stats like this: \u201cThe market averages 10% per year but the average investor averages 4%\u201d. That difference between what human investors make vs what the market returns is MASSIVE. And it all comes down to human behavior. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to understand WHAT and WHY you are doing this rather than just clicking the buttons, or else you\u2019ll be sure to go back in and unclick them one of these months and be apart of that statistic.\n\nI\u2019m doing my BEST to explain this stuff over instagram, but if you want to actually get the A-Z class on how to do that it\u2019s on sale now! Check my link in bio. It will make you millions but is only $69 through Sunday!\n\np.s. Anyone who buys a course this week also gets a free $20 gift card to the PFC shop so you can get yourself a t-shirt or mug or whatever! :)\n\nAs always, reminding you to build wealth by following the two PFC rules: 1.)

I have found @purespectrumhemp products seen here to be extremely effective in my daily pain reduction routine.\n\nShown here is their Vibrance CBD+CBG Oil, which is formulated with plants to regulate mood and naturally boost anandamide (the bliss molecule) in the body. Additionally, this product helps reduce overall pain in the body, which I have found to be incredibly helpful. \n\nI also use their Recovery Ice: High Concentration CBD cream. This cream packs 1000mg of CBD in a water-based cream designed to absorb quickly and alleviate discomfort. Formulated with all-natural ingredients (which is important to me!), this cream helps reduce pain by targeting sore muscles for a long-lasting cooling sensation. \n\nIf you suffer from chronic pain like I do, I know you\u2019ll love Pure Spectrum. If you want to receive 15% off your order, please use my code CAITLYN when shopping!\n\nMake sure to save this video to send to your friends & family so they\u2019ll know what to gift you for the holidays this year! \u2728\n\nThank you so much to my friends at @purespectrumhemp for being so kind to send me this package! \ud83e\udd0d\n\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#surgery #ehlersdanlos #ehlersdanlossyndrome #hypermobileehlersdanlossyndrome #ehlersdanlossyndromeawareness #chronicpain #chronicillness #invisibleillness #painawareness #disabled #disability #geneticdisease #invisibleillness #gastroparesis #complexregionalpainsyndrome #painawareness",

I ASKED for times like this without even realising what I was getting myself into. \n\nSo, I want to end the year with a clip of this vulnerable moment which started with minor self doubt, but ends in reaffirmation that I AM SUPPOSED to be there. \n\nYou have to feel uncomfortable at times to enter into your next evolution.

Dubbed the \u201cAmaz\u00f5nia\u201d colorway, this striking take on the sneaker begins with a brown suede mudguard. From there, its layered upper combines royal blue with neon pink while also featuring touches of seafoam green, silver and orange. Per usual, \u201cbaklava\u201d branding appears at the tongue while the plush midsole features a mix of gray, taupe and off-white.\u2060\n\u2060\nLook out for it to drop sometime in the next few months around the $220 USD price point of its predecessors.\u2060\nPhoto: Action Bronson",

Combining technical sophistication with bold, minimalist aesthetics, the timepiece reimagines Richard Mille\u2019s signature style with a rectangular, monolithic design that embodies brutalist architecture. Clean geometric lines provide elegance while the skeletonized CRMA9 in-house movement, crafted from grade 5 titanium, reveals the intricate engineering beneath its surface.\u2060\n\u2060\nAt just 4.12 mm thick, the extraflat movement features a free-sprung balance with variable inertia, ensuring greater reliability and precision over time. The timepiece additionally boasts 50 hours of power reserve and is water resistant up to 30 meters.\u2060\n\u2060\nFor those interested, the RM 16-02 Automatic Extraflat is available now with price available upon request.\u2060\nPhoto: Richard Mille",

Situated on a long, narrow plot of land, the property has a secluded feel as it is surrounded on three sides by apartments and a cemetery, providing dense plant life. Due to the unique setting, the design choice steered away from an \u201cOkinawa-like\u201d building and instead pulled inspiration from traditional Okinawan tombs.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe space features a square pyramid structure, elevated from a solid foundation of Ryukyu limestone. Limited openings in the foundation and a roof surface allow for controlled connections to the exterior while still maintaining a peaceful and tranquil living environment within the home.\u2060\n\u2060\nInterior-wise, the home is split into three distinct levels. The first includes the bathroom and entrance while the second houses the living and dining room along with a study. Meanwhile, the third level at the back contains the bedroom and other private spaces.\u2060\n\u2060\nSwipe to get a closer look at the home.\u2060\nPhoto: IGArchitects",

The program has raised $40 million USD in its two decades of running and has seen 122 patient-designers create one-of-a-kind kicks with the help of 330 Nike volunteer product experts. Now, it\u2019s finally time for the 20th collection to hit shelves.\u2060\n\u2060\nEach shoe embodies the personality and journey of these children and, for the first time, will come in a special custom, split-open box. First up, Connor Kassing Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Air Max Dn shines bright in black and gold as nods to his love for music and Spanish heritage are sprinkled in throughout. From there, the AJ6 celebrates Jillian Beagley\u2019s love for basketball with a mismatched colorway that hosts interchangeable patches of her favorite things at the collar. Quin Nims reworked the Air Max Sunder, bringing a dragon scale-inspired pattern to its special spiky mudguard shape. As for basketball aficionado Sophia Jenkins, her Sabrina 2 commemorates the many things that bring her comfort in life. As for Tima Sviridenko\u2019s Air Zoom Pegasus 41, it draws much of its inspiration from his love for cats. Lastly, Ja\u2019Kai Taylor took on the Air 180, presenting a video game-inspired blue-green gradient across its upper.\u2060\n\u2060\nRelease for all six shoes is confirmed to take place on January 25 with prices ranging from $130 USD to $200 USD.\u2060\nPhoto: Nike",

What is more beautiful than his Starry Night painting? So we got to work on how to deconstruct that painting into an ice cream and here\u2019s what we came up with. Starry Night is a white maple cinnamon ice cream swirled with a rich blue vanilla ice cream to mimic Van Gogh\u2019s brush strokes, studded with golden honeecomb \u201cstars\u201d and chocolate syrup drizzle to showcase the swirling sky and bright stars. It is available at all shops through February 1st.

The blocks are larger, safer (less slippery), and will better prepare our athletes for competition in the post season. They will have adjustable wedges and handrails, such as those seen at our North Sectional and State meet venues (as well as the summer Olympics in Paris). This campaign was kickstarted by a very generous donation from a master swimmer earlier this year.\nPlease give if you can to help support this endeavor.\n\nhttps://givebutter.com/rocktheblocks\n\n#concordcarlislehighschool #concordcarlisle #concordmass #carlislemassachusetts #concordma #carlislemass #concordmassachusetts #carlislema #welovecchs",

But, in this industry people have a tendency to get stuck on how much money a specific item is going to bring them in return, rather than looking at the bigger picture. \n\nThe bigger picture, and the truth of the matter is this:\nYes, guests book for the amenities.  But what they REVIEW, and what they RETURN FOR, is the experience.  And the overall guest experience means nailing the details. \n\nWe focus on the details, and by doing that the big picture comes together just right. \n\nIt\u2019s the whole thing together that is going to determine ROI, not just hot tub vs sauna or comforters vs. duvets (although the answer is almost always hot tub if you can\u2019t do both, and duvets if your cleaners will agree to it \ud83d\ude05)\n\nThe thing is, Airbnb has started getting a bad name because of the hosts who focus too much on the dollars in their pocket and not enough on the service they are providing.

After a recent sojourn in France, we at LUSH felt compelled to share this culinary treasure. Imagine, if you will, tender snails luxuriating in a butter infused with garlic, lemon, parsley, white wine, and just a hint of black pepper\u2014a rich, comforting embrace that requires no passport, only a willingness to savor.\n\nBut perhaps snails are not your preference. No matter. For those who shy away from the thought of such creatures, we present the \u201cescar-NO\u201d option. Here, we substitute juicy chicken thighs, gently poached in that same sumptuous butter. The effect is nearly identical\u2014a harmonious symphony of flavors, but with a more familiar, approachable centerpiece.\n\nWhether you lean toward the adventurous or the traditional, your palate is in for a journey. Come to LUSH and let us whisk you away to the charm of a Parisian bistro, one buttery morsel at a time. We won\u2019t pry into your choice; we\u2019ll simply delight in your enjoyment.

    "caption": "What is DSG Transmission?\n\nDSG (Direct-Shift Gearbox) transmission is an advanced dual-clutch system designed to give you smoother, faster, and more efficient gear shifts. Unlike traditional automatic transmissions, DSG uses two clutches that pre-select the next gear, allowing for nearly instantaneous shifts without any loss of power. This results in a driving experience that\u2019s not only more responsive but also more fuel-efficient. Whether you\u2019re navigating city streets or cruising on the highway, DSG ensures you\u2019re always in the right gear at the right time, delivering a seamless and exhilarating drive. With its lightning-fast shifts, DSG enhances both performance and comfort, making your driving experience truly enjoyable.\n\nThe following models have been offered either currently or in the past in the Indian market:\n\n7-Speed DSG (DQ200): This version is often found in smaller, less powerful cars. It\u2019s designed for maximum fuel efficiency and comfort, especially in city driving. Offered in cars like the Virtus, Polo, Vento etc.\n\n6-Speed DSG (DQ250): This version is commonly used in more powerful cars and offers a balance of performance and efficiency. Offered in cars like the Jetta and the passat.\n\n7-Speed Wet DSG (DQ381): Designed for high-performance vehicles with even greater power and torque. Like the 6-speed DSG, these also use wet clutches, ensuring durability and smooth operation even in more demanding driving conditions. Offered in cars like the Tiguan.\n\nExperience the best of both worlds with DSG,\nsmooth, fast, and efficient gear shifts for a more enjoyable drive.\n\n@volkswagen_india @group_shaman \n\n#volkswagen #volks #vw #cars #vagcars #germancars #carsofinstagram #carswithoutlimits #carstagram",

Load up on kiwi, broccoli, oats, carrots, and raspberries. \nBonus: try a DIY \u201cgut sweeper\u201d mix with flaxseed meal, slippery elm, and chia seeds\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2728 Go for Aloe: aloe vera isn\u2019t just for skin - it soothes the digestive tract and supports healthy bowel movements. Add 60ml of Aloe Vera juice to your day (without sodium benzoate)\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2728Magnesium for the Win: magnesium powder + water = relaxed muscles, smoother digestion, and stress relief!

Like any food, it\u2019s best in moderation. \ud83e\udd51 \n\nThe most distinctive quality of avocado oil, compared with olive oil, is its high smoke point. This means you can use it at higher temperatures before it burns. Try it next time you\u2019re cooking with high heat, such as roasting, grilling or pan-frying. For the most health benefits, look for unrefined, cold-pressed avocado oil. Although avocado oil is very heat stable, processing may affect the levels of protective antioxidants.",

    "caption": "We\u2019re among the first hospitals in the U.S. to offer the FDA-approved tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes therapy for solid tumor cancer. The treatment amplifies immune cells in a patient\u2019s tumor and enhances their ability to fight the cancer. It\u2019s the first cellular therapy for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who haven\u2019t responded to other treatments.\n \nHere\u2019s how it works. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TIL therapy leverages the body\u2019s own T lymphocytes that are in contact with a harvested tumor site to seek out and destroy other tumors cells and targets. TIL cells recognize and attack tumor cells. However, it requires many of these cells to do the job. The goal is to make enough cells for the therapy to succeed.\n \nThe process begins with a surgeon removing a melanoma tumor from the patient. Immune cells from the tumor are then isolated and extracted in a lab and made into an infusion later sent to the patient\u2019s care team. After this process, the patient receives a lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen to prepare their body to accept the TIL cells that will be infused. Within 24 hours of the lymphodepleting chemotherapy, the generated TIL cells are infused back into the patient, where they then work to find and destroy the melanoma tumor cells.\n \nWhen the FDA granted accelerated approval of TIL treatment with lifileucel for patients with metastatic melanoma, we were one of 23 select Early-Authorized Treatment Centers across the country approved to administer this new form of cellular therapy.\n \nTrials are underway for TIL therapy in patients with other cancers as well as studies of other TIL products. Researchers believe this treatment approach is likely to benefit patients with a wide range of solid tumors.",

Her resilience made this accomplishment possible even amid an aortic dissection and cancer diagnosis.\u2063\n\u2063\nEver since she was young, Molly\u2019s heart was monitored because of her family history of aortic dissections. \u201cWhen I initially evaluated Molly, her above average size aorta with her family history was a marker even before we had the benefit of positive genetic testing,\u201d says pediatric cardiologist Dr. Kenneth Zahka, who adds testing later confirmed Molly has an ACTA2 mutation, which increases a person\u2019s risk of aortic aneurysms and dissections.\u2063\n\u2063\nAfter finding an abrupt increase in the size of her aorta, Dr. Zahka referred her to cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Eric Roselli, who decided to move forward with surgery to address her dilated aorta. \u201cWe were able to save Molly\u2019s valve while replacing her root and ascending aorta to prevent her from having what we call a Type A dissection, which is a serious, life-threatening emergency. We also replaced her arch to prepare for later potential aortic problems,\u201d says Dr. Roselli.\u2063\n\u2063\nFrom there, Molly was regularly monitored for any changes with her aorta. She thought everything was back to normal up until a little over three years after her first surgery when she had a Type B dissection, which is typically less dangerous than a Type A dissection. \u201cBecause I did that more extended repair a few years prior, we were able to better control her condition in the intensive care unit and then get her treated with a minimally invasive operation,\u201d says Dr. Roselli.\u2063\n\u2063\nWhile addressing the dissection, Molly\u2019s care team spotted a nodule on her thyroid, which testing confirmed was thyroid cancer. Amid juggling doctor\u2019s appointments, Molly managed to graduate college and currently has no evidence of cancer after treatment. She credits her care team with saving her life and being able to go on to meet her husband, Briggs Krause, who Molly learned is also a patient of Dr. Zahka\u2019s. In October 2024, Molly and Briggs said, \u201cI do.\u201d",

Yep it\u2019s a lot, but I wanted fast Instagram growth and I\u2019m in a sprint.\n\nRESEARCH: I researched up my audience\u2019s top goals, problems, and questions and made my reels about those.\n\n(This is also how I built a following of 270K on TikTok and helped my students hit 3.8M followers and over 1B views.)\n\nPATH: I looked for proven reel formulas (one that went viral) or a from successful creator in my niche to model. Then I put my own spin on the reel.\n\nHOOKS: Right now I\u2019m using strong text hooks that use curiosity, are specific, highlight a pain point, problem or a result they want. These work! \n\nLUCK & STRATEGY: I saw another creator go viral with a remix\u2026 So I remixed the same video, and mine went viral too.\ud83e\udd2f\n\nSOUNDS: I chose small trending sounds, usually under 10K. For text on screen videos, I tried to make them loop and go to the caption.\n\nCOMMENTS: I focussed on comments instead of likes, and responded with a question to boost the engagement and connection further \u2764\ufe0f\n\nVALUE BOMBS: Every video I tried to give as much value as possible. I asked myself: What would make them want to save or hit follow?\n\nTEXT ON SCREEN TO CAPTION: I spend time writing a value-rich caption because the reel loops in the background getting more views and I gain credibility with the details I add here.\n\nSERIES: One of the best helpers for Instagram growth was making a series and repeating best types of videos! \n\nTAKE ACTION: I asked people to take action in as many places as possible: Verbally & in the caption in multiple places for people to: \n\n\ud83d\udca5Drop \u201cI\u2019m next\u201d in the comments if you\u2019re ready grow Instagram and explode your business!\n\u2764\ufe0fFollow for faster Instagram growth\n\u2708\ufe0fShare this with a friend who\u2019s trying to grow!!\n\n#reelsideas #reelsstrategy #instagramgrowth #instagramforbusiness #engagementgrowth #instagramgrowth #howtogrowyourinstagram #fempreneurs #socialmediatips  #socialmediahelp #socialmediastrategy #contenttips #viralreels #instagramforbusiness",

I also used text on screen with a question. And I used music that made it sounds like something was going to \u201chappen\u201d.\n\nAll of this grabs attention & makes people want to watch.

And we don\u2019t want to guess about this if you want to increase your reach.\n\nIt\u2019s time to do some research. What are your audience\u2019s top problems, goals or questions?\n\nI didn\u2019t guess for this reel. I know that one of my audience\u2019s biggest problems is low reach.\n\nAnd, I made sure my hook was exactly what my audience is asking - or typing into Google.\n\n3. Rewatch:\nWhat\u2019s one of the best ways to boost your reach on Instagram? Keep people watching for longer.\n\nThe longer people watch your reel, the greater the signal to Instagram that your content is worth pushing to more people.\n\nSo, you can get people to read your caption, or you can also make something interesting happen on screen so people want to re-watch.\n\nIn my reel, I made words pop up on my claps, & I kicked text onto the screen.\n\nA lot of people will watch the reel again because it was interesting, then they\u2019ll go to the caption to read.\n\n\ud83d\udc49Comment \u201c57\u201d to get my free Viral Hooks Cheat Sheet\n\nInspired by @itssosimple_rs\n\n\ud83d\udc49Save this for your next easy reel\n\n\ud83d\ude80Follow @misscarolineflett to grow on Instagram\n\n\ud83e\udef6Share this strategy with a friend\n\n#instagramgrowth #instagramforbusiness #howtogrowyourinstagram #fempreneurs",

And, did you know they have a 5 star google rating with over 10,000 (!!!) reviews? \n\nThis was my first time at the Escape Game, and only my second time doing an escape room ever - and I can see why this particular site is so beloved. The puzzles were well thought out, the staff was kind and appropriately helpful, and everything seemed clean and organized. \n\nThis is the perfect summer activity when the big kids are starting to get restless (best for ages 13 and up) or for when family is visiting and you need something the whole group can do. They also have late night games if you want to extend a date night! \n\nI definitely recommend the Special Ops room we did, but there are all kinds of scenarios at varying skill levels, so choose one that best suits you. And, if downtown or Opry Mills is more convenient, those locations have 5 stars, too!\n\nIf you\u2019ve never done an escape room, if you\u2019ve never been to @theescapegame, or if it\u2019s just been too long, this is your sign to check it out. We had a blast and know you will, too. \n\n#nashville #thingstodo #summeractivities #thingstodoinside #escaperoom #escapegame",

We recently tried one of their rooms called \u201cThe Depths,\u201d where the objective is to uncover the secrets of a submerged lab. The room is incredibly immersive, with plenty of interactive elements to keep you engaged. The puzzles are ingeniously designed and quite challenging, so if you\u2019re tackling it as a group, it\u2019s crucial to delegate responsibilities effectively. With only sixty minutes on the clock, every second counts, so be sure to manage your time wisely. As for our experience, we were down to the wire and almost didn\u2019t make it, but we rallied together and successfully escaped! Do you have what it takes to escape this room?\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#escape #escaperoom #escapegame #escaperooms #immersive #immersiveexperience #kidsactivity #spingbreak #fun #family #familyfun #funactivities #puzzle #detective #fungames #bayareakids #kids #boys #bayarea #bayareabuzz #funtimes #funtime #funtodo #immersiveexperience #immersive",

Spoiler alert, we escaped (barely) and are already making plans to go back and try another room with new challenges!\n\nMy kids have done several escape room challenges before for friends\u2019 birthday parties and they were incredibly excited to bring their cousins along. This was my first time doing an escape room and I had no idea what to expect or how it would go with such a big age range but it was fun from start to finish.\n\nFrom the moment our one hour adventure began @theescapegame it was a high-energy, team oriented feeling as we worked together to figure out clues and codes to unlock new rooms and escape with one minute to spare. I loved that we could ask for hints when we got stuck and it was a fabulous way to bond and connect as a family.\n\nThe staff was very welcoming, kind and had a great energy! We chose the easiest room, \u201cTimeliner: Train Through Time\u201d, which was perfect for our group. The team was great about making that recommendation based upon our kids\u2019 ages and this being the first escape room for several in our group. I liked that they have a range of themes and skill levels. We also loved the location so we could grab lunch at The Cheesecake Factory on The Country Club Plaza after we escaped.\n\nI\u2019m also saving this as a gift idea for hard to shop for kids, teens and tweens for birthdays and holidays. \n\nHave you tried The Escape Game? Were you surprised to learn it was fun for all ages?\n\n#escaperoom #theescapegame #kansascity #kansascityfun #countryclubplaza #familytime @theescapegame @countryclubplaza",

Good crust\n\n3) I got ketchup but the ranch that came with it was very complementary to my taste buds \n\nMy verdict???\n \nA good thing was done here! \ud83e\udd24\n\nI'll give it 8 out of 10 stars\n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50__ __\n\n-\ud83e\udd74 only because for $3.99 I would rather get a medium sized portion of pickle fries and not the kiddie small \n\n#hack \nif you get a meal, you can sub the regular fries for pickle fries for $1.50 +1\u2b50\n\nHas anyone else tried these yet??\n\n#food #picklefries #burgerking #yum #snack",

We eat when you\u2019re hungry and stop when starting to feel full (never past that point).\n\nFor years, I thought my constant hunger, cravings, and obsession with food meant I just wasn\u2019t \u201cdisciplined\u201d enough. I blamed myself for not being able to stick to diets or resist temptation. But here\u2019s the truth: it was never about willpower.\n\nWhen your hormones are out of balance, no amount of willpower can overcome the chaos happening inside your body.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned:\n\n\ud83d\udc9a GLP-1, a hormone from your gut, keeps blood sugar stable, slows digestion, and helps you feel satisfied after meals.\n\ud83d\udc9a Leptin (the \u201cfullness\u201d hormone) and ghrelin (the \u201chunger\u201d hormone) work together to regulate appetite\u2014but they depend on other hormones to stay balanced.\n\ud83d\udc9a Estrogen boosts GLP-1, enhances leptin sensitivity, and helps suppress ghrelin (reducing unnecessary hunger).\n\ud83d\udc9a Progesterone influences these signals, especially during the luteal phase, when it can increase ghrelin and cravings if out of balance.\n\ud83d\udc9a Cortisol disrupts this entire system when it\u2019s too high, spiking ghrelin and blocking leptin, making you feel hungrier than you really are.\n\nWhen GLP-1, leptin, and ghrelin are supported by balanced estrogen, progesterone, and cortisol, hunger and cravings feel effortless. You eat when you\u2019re hungry, stop when you\u2019re full, and don\u2019t need to rely on willpower to control your choices.",

    "caption": "The winter itch isn't just in your head - there's solid science behind why our skin becomes more irritated during colder months. When temperatures drop and indoor heating kicks in, our skin faces a perfect storm of conditions that trigger itching. \ud83e\udd76\n\nThe primary culprit is low humidity. Cold winter air holds less moisture than warm air, and indoor heating further strips the remaining humidity from our environment. Our skin responds by losing water more rapidly through a process called transepidermal water loss. This compromises our skin barrier - the protective outer layer that keeps moisture in and irritants out.\n\nA compromised skin barrier sets off a chain reaction. The dry, damaged barrier activates nerve endings, which send itch signals to our brain. \ud83e\udde0\n\nAdditionally, when skin becomes too dry, it releases inflammatory compounds that amplify the itch sensation. This explains why scratching provides temporary relief but ultimately makes things worse by further damaging the barrier.\n\nFor people with eczema (atopic dermatitis), winter presents additional challenges. Their skin already has a weakened barrier function due to genetic factors affecting certain proteins. The harsh winter conditions exacerbate this vulnerability, leading to more frequent and severe flare-ups.\n\nTHE SOLUTION LIES IN SUPPORTING OUR SKIN BARRIER:\n\ud83d\udc49Using thick moisturizers immediately after bathing to trap water in the skin\n\ud83d\udc49Installing humidifiers to maintain indoor moisture levels\n\ud83d\udc49Taking shorter, lukewarm showers instead of hot baths\n\ud83d\udc49Wearing soft, breathable fabrics that don't irritate the skin. \n\nUnderstanding this science helps explain why simply scratching isn't the answer. Instead, focusing on barrier repair and humidity management can provide lasting relief from winter's persistent itch. \u2744\ufe0f\n\n#winter #eczema #dryskin #hydration #skincaretips #codexlabs",

    "caption": "The Skin-Gut-Brain-Biome \u201cAxis\u201d is believed to explain correlations among the gut microbiota, emotional states, and systemic skin inflammation. \n\nMany skin disorders are now thought to originate in the gut microbiome.  Disturbances in mucosal lining, microbiome dysbiosis, overgrowth of bacteria in small intestines, can all appear as rashes, flares, or even the onset of skin diseases such as acne, eczema, or psoriasis. \n\nImbalance of the intestinal microbiome can cause excess bacterial growth of pathobionts, leading to competition for nutrients and toxic metabolite production. This results in local and systemic inflammation affecting the physiology of the skin. Maintaining the integrity of tight junctions and the permeability of intestinal epithelial cells is crucial.\n\nThere is a link between the gut microbiome and eczema, and some research suggests that changes to the gut microbiome may be a factor in the development of eczema.  This imbalance may contribute to the inflammation and immune responses that are implicated in eczema.\n\nA study found that the gut microbiome of infants with eczema differed from that of healthy infants. The study found that pathogenic species such as Escherichia, Shigella or Clostridium were more abundant in infants with eczema, while the species Bifidobacterium was more abundant in healthy infants [1].\n\nEating a plant-based, anti-inflammatory diet may help some people with eczema. Eating fermented foods while pregnant may reduce the risk of a child developing eczema [2].\n\nReferences:\n1.\thttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5094743/\n2.\thttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/eczema-gut-health#\n\n#codexlabs #biohacking #biotechnology #bioscience #skincare #eczema #guthealth #probiotics #microbiome",

And 27% drive without any insurance at all.\n\nWatch Attorney Ethan break down Florida auto insurance limits, then read the recap below to review which policies are required and available to all Florida drivers.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Property Damage Liability (PDL) - required\nPDL covers damage to others' property, but not your own vehicle. Florida requires a minimum of $10,000 PDL coverage.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Personal Injury Protection (PIP) - required\nFlorida law mandates PIP, covering 80% of medical expenses up to $10,000 from a covered injury, regardless of fault. PIP also provides $5,000 in death benefits for fatalities.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Bodily Injury Liability (BIL) - elective for most (required for some*)\nBIL safeguards others if you're at fault in a severe accident. While not mandatory for most, it's recommended. BIL covers medical costs, legal fees, loss of income, pain and suffering, and more.\n\n*BIL is required for drivers with a DUI conviction within 3 years.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Uninsured & Underinsured Motorist Coverage - elective\nUM/UIM protects you from at-fault drivers with no bodily liability insurance. UM also kicks in if you exceed your PIP coverage. \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Collision Coverage - elective\nCollision insurance pays for vehicle damage from accidents, regardless of fault. It covers repairs when the other driver has insufficient or no insurance.\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Comprehensive Coverage - elective\nComprehensive auto insurance coverage is designed to cover damage to your vehicle that is not caused by a crash with another vehicle. For example, a cracked windshield as a result of flying debris.\n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Medical Payment - elective\nMedPay covers medical expenses up to your policy's limit, supplementing PIP.\n\nFlorida's required car insurance minimums might not offer the protection you need. We strongly advise drivers to seek insurance above these mandated levels. \n\nOur legal team can go over your policy with you and answer any questions regarding your coverage. Your financial well-being deserves proper protection. \n\nCall us at 855-800-8000 for a free consultation.",

This evidence can be used by an attorney to strengthen your case. \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Not collecting evidence\nTake photos of your vehicle, the other driver's vehicle, any injuries you may have, and any other proof that contributed to the accident. \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Filing for insurance ASAP\nFiling for insurance too soon can hurt your case since you may lack evidence or proof that you were the victim. While prompt action is essential, it shouldn't be rushed.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Admitting fault\nRushing to report can lead to accidental admissions of fault. Avoid speaking to your insurance adjuster without consulting an attorney first.\n\n6\ufe0f\u20e3 Delaying legal help\nDon't make the mistake of waiting to contact an attorney until you run into issues with the insurance adjuster. The best way to prevent this is to contact a car accident lawyer before talking to your insurance. \n\n7\ufe0f\u20e3 Talking to other driver's insurance reps\nSteer clear of conversations with the other driver's insurance. Their aim is to minimize their client's responsibility.\n\n8\ufe0f\u20e3 Settling too early\nHandling your claim independently can lead to early settlements, potentially shortchanging your compensation. An attorney can help you determine a fair offer and what you need in your situation.\n\nAt Frankl Kominsky Injury Lawyers, we are here to guide you through the process, ensuring your evidence builds the strongest possible claim.

This oil smells simply irresistible and it left my hair super silky and shiny. It does say it helps with frizzy hair but of course right now I don\u2019t have that issue (since it\u2019s almost winter). But I will definitely be using this into the spring and summer months too.

We would like him to think of his culture as something he can share with people he meets along the way, rather than something he has to mask just to fit in. I suppose the best way to do that is to lead by example.\n\nIf I had to name one thing I\u2019m proud of, it would be my ability to trust my self. Being a mum requires you to think on your feet and there isn\u2019t always a right and a wrong. Everyone\u2019s journey as a parent is different and I have learnt that no one knows my child better than I do.\u201d - @riakamat, mother to Khai.

It was a huge goal, but one I believed I could reach. Fast forward to November 29, 2024, and we did it. We hit 1 million.\n\nI\u2019ve been reflecting on this year, and I have a lot of emotions about getting here. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned is that the path to success isn\u2019t linear, and no one is going to save you or do the work for you. I worked my ass off for this\u2014I didn\u2019t expect a pat on the back or a congratulations. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019m proud of myself, and that\u2019s enough. Proving to myself that I\u2019m capable is all I\u2019ve ever cared about.\n\nI love YouTube, I love being a healer, and I love my patients and everyone who supports me on this journey especially my wonderful family. Thank you all!\n\nFor 2025, I\u2019ll see you at 2 million. \u270c\ud83c\udffb",

We are not against recipes like a quick, simple and effective face mask made from crushed oat and honey, or a body scrub with coffee grounds and olive oil. But homemade beauty that\u2019s more elaborate than this presents a few downsides: a lack of preservatives or ingredients such as lemon juice, baking soda, or cinnamon that are too harsh on the skin and can cause more harm than good. \n\nIf you want to keep your skincare affordable, you can always switch more expensive face and body creams with multipurpose body butters and oils such as jojoba, coconut and shea butter. And if you\u2019re looking for tried and tested DIY beauty recipes, our sister brand @acalaonline offers beautiful sets, from skincare to makeup ranges, to have fun and experiment with creating your own tinted lip balms, or toothpaste, for instance.

So here are some quick and easy tips on how to keep your whole body nourished and radiant. \u26c4\ufe0f \n\n1) Follow a skincare routine that is specific to colder weather: apply a thick water-based face and body cream followed by a natural oil of your choice (like jojoba or shea butter) to lock in moisture, and try to adopt a night-time routine, too; 2) Remember to exfoliate: not a summer-only but a year-round good practice, exfoliation helps with skin rejuvenation; 3) Healthy skin starts from the inside out, so try to switch to a more nourishing eating regimen, implementing mineral-rich veggies, seeds for omega, and warming herbal teas for hydration. 4) Keep your skin barrier strong: if you can, avoid extreme cold and indoor heating, both causes of a more dry and irritated skin. \n\nIf you are intrigued to discover more of our skincare experts\u2019 suggestions, read our blog by clicking the link in our bio.\n\n#odylique #ukskincarebrand #organicskincare #christmasgiftsets #skincaregifts #christmaspresents #skincareforeveryone #hypoallergenicskincare #organicchristmas",

Press Q (this enters quick mask mode)\u200b\n2. Set the foreground color to dark grey\u200b\nTip: darker grey will get you closer to the original image, while lighter grey will let Photoshop be more creative with the paint strokes\u200b\n3. Press alt-backspace, which applies the color and creates a transparent selection\u200b\n4. Press Q again (to exit quick mask mode)\u200b\n5. Click \u201cGenerative Fill\u201d and type \u201coil painting\u201d\u200b\n\nHow do you get the frames to be consistent with each other?\u200b\nIt\u2019s a bit of trial and error. Each time you try generative fill you get 3 results, and I go through them to pick out the one that is most consistent with the previous frame. If none of them are consistent, then I try generating again.\u200b\n\nDo you have to go frame by frame?\u200b\nWith this technique using Photoshop Generative Fill you have to go frame by frame, and using an Intel powered AI PC can speed things up when you\u2019re working with a lot of images. But there are other techniques (e.g. using ComfyUI) that let you apply a painting effect to an entire video. See my May 7 post caption for that workflow. Using ComfyUI lets you get a more consistent look, however sometimes I prefer the stylistic paint brush goopyness of Photoshop\u2019s Generative Fill paint effect.\u200b\n\nCredits\u200b\nvideo by @karenxcheng\u200b\nproducer @katalinadrojas\u200b\nclient @intel\u200b\n\n#IntelAmbassador #IntelCoreUltra #AIPC #Dell\u200b\n\nspecial thanks:\u200b\n\nI learned the shorcut sequence from @piximperfect @unmeshdinda and the video technique from @paolomarktwo\u200b",

Intel has partnered with Adobe to optimize AI-related tasks like this one. Especially useful when you\u2019re editing lots of images\n3. Bring the images into Adobe Premiere to test out the flow of the choreography\n4. The trickiest part was figuring out how the choreography played with gravity, so I iterated and repeated steps 1-3 over and over until it felt right\n5. I wanted the video to have a flipbook feel, so I printed the pictures out and captured them in stop motion\n6. Final step, add music and sound effects\n\nEdited on my DELL XPS 13 powered by Intel Core Ultra #IntelAmbassador #IntelCoreUltra #AIPC #Dell\n\nDirector & Editor @karenxcheng\nProducer @katalinadrojas\nSound Foley @likuidaudio",

If #Nirbhaya  case has not had an impact and this brutal atrocity continues, then what HARSH steps need to be taken to put the fear of God in the perpetuators. Obviously the fear of prosecution has no impact on these low life beasts. So they need to be treated like beasts. My heart goes out to the family of the victim. There is nothing we can do or say to ever ease the pain of this tragedy for the rest of their lives. For what it\u2019s worth my deepest apologies to all professionals in the medical field. We keep letting you down on every other turn. I know for a fact that you  go way beyond the call of duty every day and every day we take that for granted. I feel repulsed. Somebody must\u2019ve thought it\u2019s OK for things like this to happen in that medical college in Kolkota.. I hope they get identified and treated the way only they understand ..while setting an example for all others . Deeply anguished and heart broken.",

I sat on the footage for a while as I couldn\u2019t watch it for months, given how fresh the reality of the unfolding events that started in an unprecedented way on 24th of Feb in Ukraine were - the seeds of which are echoed in my story which is set years prior: in 2014.

His 20+ year long work on the streets of Brighton Beach and Coney Island - despite the mafia, governmental red-tape, and harsh winters trying to shut him down, still fervently continues. His house contains a small church inside and a couple of bedrooms that house people battling addiction. The arc of these stories sometimes take a while to reveal its shape, but it\u2019s such a great privilege to be there, and to see a man walk so definitively in his mission.",
